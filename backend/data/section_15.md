Unit 2: 6 Be able to understand the life-course of the musculoskeletal system and its implications for
special populations exercise
6.1 Describe the life-course of the musculoskeletal system, including relevant tendon, ligament,
muscle, joint and bone mineral density changes, and their implications for exercise, plus specific
evidence-based implications for working with:
• young people in the 13-18 age range
• antenatal and postnatal women
• older people (50 plus)
• disabled people
The student should begin by explaining that the musculoskeletal system undergoes changes throughout
the human life course. These changes affect bones, muscles, tendons, ligaments, and joints, influencing
physical performance and exercise suitability. The essay will explore these changes and their practical
implications for specific populations, including young people, older adults, antenatal/postnatal women,
and disabled individuals.

1. Musculoskeletal Changes Over Time:
   o Bones: Bone mineral density (BMD) peaks in early adulthood and declines with age,
   increasing the risk of fractures in older adults.
   o Muscles: Muscle mass and strength increase during adolescence, peak in adulthood,
   and decline (sarcopenia) with aging.
   o Tendons and Ligaments: These become less elastic with age, increasing injury risk and
   reducing flexibility.
   o Joints: Cartilage wears down over time, potentially leading to joint stiffness and
   arthritis.
2. Implications for Exercise:
   o Young People (13–18): Require supervision to protect growth plates and avoid
   overtraining. Exercise should support healthy development and coordination.
   o Antenatal/Postnatal Women: Hormonal changes affect joint stability; focus on low-
   impact, pelvic floor–friendly activities and gradual return to fitness post-birth.
   o Older Adults (50+): Exercise should address reduced BMD and muscle strength. Include
   balance, resistance, and flexibility training.
   o Disabled People: Programmes must be adapted for mobility, coordination, or cognitive
   challenges while promoting independence and confidence.
   Essay Snippet 6.1
   Throughout the human life-course, the musculoskeletal system experiences significant structural and
   functional changes. During adolescence, rapid growth occurs, with increases in bone length, muscle
   mass, and joint flexibility. Peak bone mineral density (BMD) and muscle strength are typically achieved in
   the 20s and 30s. With aging, BMD and muscle mass begin to decline, tendons and ligaments lose
   elasticity, and joints may become less mobile due to cartilage degeneration.
