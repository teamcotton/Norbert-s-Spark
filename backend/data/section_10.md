Unit 2: 4. Be able to understand joints in the skeleton
4.6 Describe anatomical terms in relation to the anatomical position
The student should begin by explaining that anatomical terms provide a universal language for
describing body positions and directions. These terms are based on the anatomical position, which is a
standardised posture used as a reference point in anatomy.
• Anatomical Position: The body standing upright, facing forward, feet together, arms at the sides
with palms facing forward.
• Directional Terms: Such as superior (above), inferior (below), anterior (front), posterior (back),
medial (toward the midline), lateral (away from the midline), proximal (closer to the point of
attachment), and distal (farther from the point of attachment).
• These terms help accurately describe locations and relationships of body parts.
Essay Snippet 4.6
Anatomical terms are essential for clear communication in health and fitness fields. They are based on
the anatomical position, where the body stands upright, facing forward, with feet together and palms
facing forward. This position serves as a reference point for all directional terms. Terms like superior and
inferior describe positions above or below; anterior and posterior refer to front and back; medial and
lateral indicate closeness or distance from the midline. Proximal and distal describe locations relative to
a limb’s attachment. Understanding these terms ensures precise description of body parts and
movements…
