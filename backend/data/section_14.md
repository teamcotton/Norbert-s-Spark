Unit 2: 5. Be able to understand the muscular system 2. Joint Actions Produced by Muscle Contractions:
o Flexion and Extension: Decreasing or increasing joint angle (e.g., elbow flexion by
biceps, extension by triceps).
o Abduction and Adduction: Movement away from or toward the midline (e.g., raising
arm sideways - deltoid).
o Rotation: Circular movement around an axis (e.g., turning the head with
sternocleidomastoid).
o Other actions: Circumduction, pronation, supination, dorsiflexion, plantarflexion. 3. Role of Muscle Relationships Around a Joint:
o Agonist (Prime Mover): Main muscle producing movement.
o Antagonist: Muscle that opposes the agonist to control or stop movement.
o Synergist: Assists the agonist to produce smooth movement.
o Fixator: Stabilises the origin of the agonist muscle during movement. 4. Skeletal Muscle Fibre Types and Characteristics:
o Type I (Slow Twitch): Fatigue-resistant, suited for endurance, rely on aerobic
metabolism.
o Type IIa (Fast Twitch, Oxidative): Moderate resistance to fatigue, can use aerobic and
anaerobic metabolism.
o Type IIx (Fast Twitch, Glycolytic): High power, fatigue quickly, rely on anaerobic
metabolism.
Essay Snippet 5.8 – 5.11
Muscle actions are fundamental for producing movement and maintaining posture. There are different
types of muscle contractions, each playing a specific role in movement control. Isotonic contractions
occur when a muscle changes length to move a joint. During concentric action, the muscle shortens, such
as when the biceps contract to lift a dumbbell. In eccentric action, the muscle lengthens under tension,
like lowering the weight slowly. Isometric contractions happen when the muscle generates force without
changing length, as seen when holding a plank position…

• disabled people
Introduction: Be Able to Understand the Life-Course of the Musculoskeletal System and Its
Implications for Special Populations Exercise
Understanding the life-course of the musculoskeletal system involves recognising how bones, muscles,
and joints develop, mature, and change throughout a person’s life. These changes impact strength,
flexibility, and mobility at different ages and stages. For special populations—such as children, older
adults, or those with musculoskeletal conditions—this knowledge is vital to tailor exercise programmes
that accommodate their unique needs, promote safety, and support healthy function across the
lifespan.
