Introduction: Be Able to Understand Energy Systems and Their Relation to Exercise
Understanding energy systems is vital to knowing how the body produces and uses energy during
different types of exercise. The three main energy systems—the ATP-PC system, anaerobic glycolysis,
and aerobic system—support varying intensities and durations of activity. Knowledge of these systems
helps fitness professionals design training programmes that optimise performance, improve endurance,
and support recovery.
7.1 Describe how carbohydrates, fats and proteins are used in the production of energy/adenosine
triphosphate
7.2 Explain the use of the three energy systems during aerobic and anaerobic exercise
7.3 Describe how the duration and intensity of exercise affects the engagement of energy systems
The student should begin by explaining that the body requires a constant supply of energy, in the form
of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to fuel muscular activity. ATP is regenerated through three primary
energy systems, each with different roles depending on the intensity and duration of exercise. The essay
should cover how carbohydrates, fats, and proteins contribute to ATP production, and how these energy
systems are engaged during both aerobic and anaerobic activity.

1. Macronutrient Use in Energy Production:
   o Carbohydrates: The primary fuel source during moderate to high-intensity exercise.
   Broken down into glucose, stored as glycogen, and used quickly to regenerate ATP.
   o Fats: Utilised during low to moderate-intensity aerobic exercise. Provide a large amount
   of ATP, but the process is slower.
   o Proteins: Used minimally; primarily during prolonged endurance exercise or when
   glycogen stores are depleted. Broken down into amino acids for energy.
2. The Three Energy Systems:
   o ATP-PCr (Phosphagen) System: Anaerobic; provides immediate energy for very short,
   high-intensity bursts (0–10 seconds). Uses stored phosphocreatine, no oxygen required.
   o Anaerobic Glycolysis (Lactic Acid) System: Anaerobic; provides energy for activities
   lasting 10 seconds to 2 minutes. Uses glucose to produce ATP and lactic acid as a by-
   product.

   Unit 2: 7. Be able to understand energy systems and their relation to exercise
   o Aerobic System: Uses oxygen; dominates in low to moderate-intensity, long-duration
   exercise. Breaks down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins to produce large amounts of
   ATP.
3. Effect of Duration and Intensity:
   o Short, explosive efforts (e.g., sprinting, jumping): rely on ATP-PCr.
   o Moderate efforts (e.g., 400m run): use anaerobic glycolysis.
   o Long-duration efforts (e.g., distance running, cycling): primarily use aerobic system.
   Essay Snippet 7.1 – 7.3
   Energy is essential for all forms of physical activity, and the body relies on the molecule adenosine
   triphosphate (ATP) to power muscle contractions. Since ATP is stored in small quantities within the
   muscles, it must be continuously regenerated through three key energy systems that utilise
   carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.
   Carbohydrates are the body's preferred energy source, especially during high-intensity activity. Glucose
   derived from carbohydrates can be used in both anaerobic and aerobic pathways to quickly regenerate
   ATP. Fats, on the other hand, provide a more sustained but slower form of energy, mainly used during
   prolonged, lower-intensity aerobic exercise. Proteins play a limited role in energy production, usually
   serving as a backup when carbohydrate and fat stores are low, such as during extreme endurance
   events.
   The ATP-PCr system is the fastest way to produce energy, using stored phosphocreatine in the muscles to
   regenerate ATP without oxygen. It supports activities like sprinting or weightlifting that last under 10
   seconds. For slightly longer efforts, the anaerobic glycolytic system kicks in. This system also operates
   without oxygen and uses glucose to generate ATP, but it results in the production of lactic acid, which
   can cause fatigue. It powers moderate efforts lasting from 10 seconds to about 2 minutes, such as a 400-
   meter sprint…
