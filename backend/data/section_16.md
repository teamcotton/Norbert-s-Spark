Unit 2: 6 Be able to understand the life-course of the musculoskeletal system and its implications for
special populations exercise
These changes have clear implications for exercise prescription across different populations. Young
people (13–18) are still developing, so exercise should be safe, enjoyable, and focused on coordination
and foundational strength while avoiding overloading growth plates. Antenatal and postnatal women
experience hormonal changes, especially increased relaxin, which loosens ligaments and affects joint
stability. Exercise should be modified to include low-impact movements, pelvic floor support, and a
gradual return to fitness postpartum.
For older adults (50+), the decline in BMD and muscle mass increases fall and fracture risk. Weight-
bearing and resistance training can counteract these effects, while flexibility and balance exercises
improve mobility and stability. Disabled individuals may require tailored exercise approaches based on
their physical or cognitive abilities, but the emphasis should be on promoting function, independence,
and overall wellbeing…
