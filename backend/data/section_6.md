Unit 2: 3. Be able to understand the structure and function of the skeleton

1. Classification of Bones:
   o Long Bones: Longer than they are wide; designed for strength and movement.
   Examples: femur, humerus, tibia.
   o Short Bones: Approximately equal in length, width, and thickness; provide stability and
   support with limited movement. Examples: carpals (wrist bones), tarsals (ankle bones).
   o Flat Bones: Thin and often curved; protect internal organs and provide large surfaces for
   muscle attachment. Examples: skull bones, scapula, sternum.
   o Irregular Bones: Complex shapes that don’t fit other categories; serve various functions.
   Examples: vertebrae, pelvis.
   o Sesamoid Bones: Small, round bones embedded in tendons to protect them and
   increase mechanical advantage. Example: patella (kneecap).
2. Structure of a Long Bone:
   o Diaphysis: The shaft made mostly of compact bone, providing strength.
   o Epiphyses: The ends of the bone, composed of spongy bone covered with articular
   cartilage for shock absorption and joint movement.
   o Medullary Cavity: Hollow center of the diaphysis filled with bone marrow (red in
   children for blood cell production, yellow in adults for fat storage).
   o Periosteum: Tough outer membrane covering the bone, containing nerves and blood
   vessels, aiding growth and repair.
   o Endosteum: Thin membrane lining the medullary cavity.
3. Stages of Bone Growth:
   o Ossification: The process of bone tissue formation starting in the embryo.
   o Longitudinal Growth: Growth in length occurs at the epiphyseal (growth) plates via
   cartilage proliferation and ossification.
   o Appositional Growth: Growth in width/thickness through the addition of bone tissue by
   osteoblasts in the periosteum.
   o Growth continues until the epiphyseal plates close after puberty.

   Bones in the human body are classified based on their shapes and functions, which relate directly to their
   roles in movement, support, and protection. The five main classifications include long, short, flat,
   irregular, and sesamoid bones. Long bones, such as the femur, humerus, and tibia, are longer than they
   are wide and primarily function to support weight and facilitate movement. Short bones, like the carpals
   in the wrist and tarsals in the ankle, are roughly cube-shaped, providing stability and limited motion. Flat
   bones, including the skull, scapula, and sternum, protect vital organs and offer extensive surfaces for
   muscle attachment. Irregular bones, such as vertebrae and the pelvis, have complex shapes tailored to
   their specific roles. Sesamoid bones, like the patella, are embedded in tendons to protect them and
   improve leverage.
   A typical long bone consists of several key structures. The diaphysis, or shaft, is composed mainly of
   compact bone, providing strength and support. At each end are the epiphyses, made of spongy bone and
   covered with articular cartilage, which cushions joints during movement. The central medullary cavity
   contains bone marrow—red marrow in children, which produces blood cells, and yellow marrow in
   adults, which stores fat. Surrounding the bone is the periosteum, a fibrous membrane rich in blood
   vessels and nerves, essential for growth and repair. Inside, the endosteum lines the medullary cavity…
