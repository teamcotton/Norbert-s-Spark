Unit 2: 9. Be able to understand the structure and function of the digestive system

1. Definition and Function of Digestion:
   o Digestion is the breakdown of food into smaller components so the body can absorb
   nutrients.
   o Its main functions include nutrient absorption, waste elimination, and energy
   production.
2. Structure and Functions of the Digestive System:
   o Outline key organs: mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, liver,
   pancreas, and gallbladder.
   o The stomach initiates protein breakdown; the small intestine absorbs nutrients; the
   large intestine absorbs water.
3. How the Digestive System Works:
   o Digestion begins in the mouth and can take 24–72 hours depending on the food type.
   o Enzymes (like amylase, protease, and lipase) aid in breaking down carbs, proteins, and
   fats.
   o Carbohydrates begin digestion in the mouth with salivary amylase and continue in the
   small intestine with enzymes from the pancreas.
4. Role of Liver and Pancreas:
   o The pancreas releases digestive enzymes and neutralises stomach acid.
   o The liver produces bile, which helps digest fats and aids absorption of fat-soluble
   vitamins.
5. Importance of Fluids:
   o Fluids help transport nutrients, soften stool, and move food through the digestive tract.
   o Water is essential for enzyme function and nutrient absorption.
   Essay Snippet 9.1 – 9.5
   Digestion is the process through which the body converts food into smaller, absorbable substances to
   obtain essential nutrients. This process is both mechanical and chemical, starting in the mouth and
   ending with waste excretion. The digestive system plays a vital role in energy production, nutrient
   absorption, and supporting overall health.
   The digestive system consists of several organs working in sequence. The mouth mechanically breaks
   down food, while saliva contains enzymes like amylase that start digesting carbohydrates. Food then
   travels down the oesophagus into the stomach, where acid and enzymes such as pepsin break down
   proteins. The partially digested food (chyme) moves into the small intestine, where most digestion and
   nutrient absorption occur. Here, enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the liver aid in the breakdown
   of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. The large intestine absorbs water and forms waste.
   Digestion time varies between 24–72 hours, depending on the meal's complexity. Carbohydrates are
   primarily broken down by amylase in the mouth and then further digested in the small intestine with help
   from pancreatic enzymes. The liver supports fat digestion through bile production, while the pancreas
   provides enzymes (lipase, amylase, and proteases) and neutralises stomach acid via bicarbonate
   secretion…
