Unit 2: 5. Be able to understand the muscular system 2. Cardiac Muscle:
o Found only in the heart.
o Involuntary and striated.
o Contracts rhythmically to pump blood throughout the body. 3. Smooth Muscle:
o Found in walls of internal organs (e.g., intestines, blood vessels).
o Involuntary and non-striated.
o Controls slow, sustained movements like digestion and blood flow. 4. Role of Fascia:
o A fibrous connective tissue that surrounds muscles, groups of muscles, blood vessels,
and nerves.
o Provides structural support, reduces friction between muscles during movement, and
helps transmit muscular force.
Essay Snippet 5.1 – 5.3
The human body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle, each with
distinct characteristics and functions. Skeletal muscle is voluntary and attaches primarily to bones,
allowing conscious control of movements such as walking, lifting, or posture maintenance.
Microscopically, it appears striated due to its organised structure of muscle fibers. This muscle type also
plays a vital role in producing body heat during activity. Cardiac muscle is unique to the heart. It is
involuntary and striated, enabling it to contract continuously and rhythmically without conscious effort.
These contractions pump blood efficiently throughout the circulatory system, maintaining life-sustaining
blood flow…
5.4 Describe the basic structure of skeletal muscle
5.5 Name and locate the anterior skeletal muscles
5.6 Name and locate the posterior skeletal muscles
5.7 Describe the structure and function of the pelvic floor muscles
The student should begin by introducing skeletal muscle as a type of voluntary muscle responsible for
body movement. They should outline the essay’s focus on the basic microscopic and macroscopic
structure of skeletal muscle, key anterior and posterior muscles, and the structure and function of the
pelvic floor muscles.

1. Basic Structure of Skeletal Muscle:
   o Skeletal muscle is composed of bundles of muscle fibers (cells) called fascicles.
   o Each muscle fiber contains myofibrils made of actin and myosin proteins, which
   facilitate contraction.
   o The muscle is surrounded by connective tissues:
   ▪ Epimysium (around the whole muscle)
   ▪ Perimysium (around each fascicle)
   ▪ Endomysium (around individual muscle fibers)
2. Anterior Skeletal Muscles (front of the body):
   o Examples include the pectoralis major (chest), rectus abdominis (abdomen), quadriceps
   (front thigh), and biceps brachii (front upper arm).
