Unit 2: 3. Be able to understand the structure and function of the skeleton
3.8 Describe posture in terms of:
• curves of the spine
• neutral spine alignment
• potential ranges of motion of the spine
• postural deviations to include kyphosis, lordosis, scoliosis and the effect of pregnancy and
obesity
The student should start by defining posture as the position in which someone holds their body while
standing, sitting, or moving. They should explain the importance of maintaining good posture for spinal
health and overall wellbeing. The essay will describe the natural curves of the spine, neutral spine
alignment, the spine’s potential ranges of motion, and common postural deviations including kyphosis,
lordosis, scoliosis, as well as the effects of pregnancy and obesity on posture.

1. Curves of the Spine:
   o The spine has natural curves that form an “S” shape when viewed from the side.
   o These include the cervical curve (neck), thoracic curve (upper back), and lumbar curve
   (lower back).
   o These curves help absorb shock and maintain balance.
2. Neutral Spine Alignment:
   o Neutral spine refers to maintaining the natural curves in proper alignment.
   o In this position, the head, shoulders, and hips are aligned vertically, reducing strain on
   muscles and ligaments.
3. Potential Ranges of Motion of the Spine:
   o The spine allows several movements:
   ▪ Flexion: bending forward
   ▪ Extension: bending backward
   ▪ Lateral flexion: bending side to side
   ▪ Rotation: twisting around the axis
4. Postural Deviations:
   o Kyphosis: Excessive outward curve of the thoracic spine causing a hunched back.
   o Lordosis: Excessive inward curve of the lumbar spine leading to a swayback appearance.
   o Scoliosis: Abnormal lateral curvature of the spine, often in an “S” or “C” shape.
   o Effects of Pregnancy: Increased lumbar lordosis due to weight and postural changes.
   o Effects of Obesity: Added weight, especially in the abdomen, can exaggerate lordosis
   and affect balance.
   Essay Snippet 3.8
   Posture refers to the way the body is positioned during standing, sitting, or movement, and maintaining
   good posture is crucial for spinal health and overall physical function. The spine naturally forms gentle
   curves that appear as an “S” shape when viewed from the side. These include the cervical curve in the
   neck, the thoracic curve in the upper back, and the lumbar curve in the lower back. These curves help
   absorb shock, maintain balance, and distribute mechanical stress during movement. A neutral spine
   alignment is when these natural curve s are maintained correctly…
