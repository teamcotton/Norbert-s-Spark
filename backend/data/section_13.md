Unit 2: 5. Be able to understand the muscular system 3. Posterior Skeletal Muscles (back of the body):
o Examples include the trapezius (upper back), latissimus dorsi (mid-back), hamstrings
(back of the thigh), and triceps brachii (back upper arm). 4. Pelvic Floor Muscles:
o A group of muscles located at the base of the pelvis.
o They support pelvic organs such as the bladder, intestines, and uterus (in females).
o They play a key role in bladder and bowel control, sexual function, and stabilising the
pelvis during movement.
Essay Snippet 5.4 – 5.7
Skeletal muscle is a type of voluntary muscle tissue responsible for producing movement by contracting
and pulling on bones. Its basic structure consists of bundles called fascicles, which are made up of
individual muscle fibers. Each muscle fiber contains myofibrils composed of proteins actin and myosin,
essential for contraction. Surrounding these fibers and bundles are connective tissues—the endomysium
encloses each muscle fiber, the perimysium wraps each fascicle, and the epimysium surrounds the entire
muscle—providing protection and support.
Key skeletal muscles can be divided based on their location on the front (anterior) or back (posterior) of
the body. Anterior muscles include the pectoralis major, located on the chest, responsible for arm
movements; the rectus abdominis in the abdomen, crucial for trunk flexion; the quadriceps group at the
front of the thigh, which extends the knee; and the biceps brachii at the front of the upper arm, which
flexes the elbow. Posterior muscles include the trapezius, spanning the upper back and neck, involved in
shoulder and neck movements; the latissimus dorsi, a broad muscle of the mid-back, which helps in arm
extension and rotation; the hamstrings at the back of the thigh, responsible for knee flexion; and the
triceps brachii at the back of the upper arm, which extends the elbow…
5.8 Describe the different types of muscle action
5.9 Identify the joint actions brought about by specific muscle group contractions
5.10 Describe the role of muscle relationships surrounding a joint for the production, control and
cessation of movement
5.11 Identify skeletal muscle fibre types and their characteristics
The student should begin by defining muscle actions and their importance in producing movement. The
essay will explain different types of muscle action, joint movements caused by muscle contractions, the
interaction of muscle groups around joints, and identify skeletal muscle fibre types along with their
characteristics.

1. Types of Muscle Action:
   o Isotonic Contraction: Muscle changes length to produce movement.
   ▪ Concentric: Muscle shortens (e.g., biceps during curl).
   ▪ Eccentric: Muscle lengthens while under tension (e.g., lowering a weight).
   o Isometric Contraction: Muscle length remains constant while generating force (e.g.,
   holding a plank).
