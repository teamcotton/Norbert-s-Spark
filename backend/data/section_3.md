Unit 2: 1. Be able to understand the structure and function of the circulatory system
1.7 Define blood pressure
1.8 Identify blood pressure classifications
1.9 Describe current, evidence-based blood pressure guidelines (NICE, BHF, WHO)
The student should begin by defining blood pressure as the force of blood pushing against the walls of
the arteries as the heart pumps. Monitoring and managing blood pressure is essential because abnormal
levels can lead to cardiovascular disease, stroke, and kidney damage. The essay will define blood
pressure, outline its classifications, and explain current evidence-based guidelines.

1. Definition of Blood Pressure:
   o Blood pressure is recorded as two numbers:
   ▪ Systolic: pressure when the heart contracts
   ▪ Diastolic: pressure when the heart relaxes
   o Measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg), e.g., 120/80 mmHg
2. Blood Pressure Classifications: (According to current NHS or NICE/ESC/ACC guidelines)
   o Normal: <120/80 mmHg
   o Elevated (Prehypertension): 120–129/<80 mmHg
   o Hypertension Stage 1: 130–139/80–89 mmHg
   o Hypertension Stage 2: ≥140/90 mmHg
   o Hypertensive Crisis: >180/120 mmHg (requires immediate medical attention)
3. Evidence-Based Guidelines:
   o Students should refer to up-to-date clinical sources such as the NICE Guidelines (UK) or
   American Heart Association (AHA)
   o Recommendations include regular monitoring, lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, stress
   management), and medication for elevated/stage 1+ readings
   o Emphasis on early detection to prevent long-term health risks
   Essay Snippet 1.7 – 1.9
   Blood pressure is a key indicator of cardiovascular health, defined as the force exerted by circulating
   blood on the walls of the arteries. It is expressed in two values: systolic pressure, which occurs when the
   heart contracts, and diastolic pressure, which occurs when the heart relaxes. Blood pressure is measured
   in millimetres of mercury (mmHg), with a normal reading typically around 120/80 mmHg.
   Blood pressure classifications help identify individuals at risk of hypertension and related health issues.
   According to widely recognised guidelines, such as those from the American Heart Association and NICE
   in the UK, readings below 120/80 mmHg are considered normal. Readings between 120–129 systolic and
   below 80 diastolic are classified as elevated. Stage 1 hypertension is diagnosed when readings are
   between 130–139/80–89 mmHg, while Stage 2 occurs at 140/90 mmHg or higher. A hypertensive crisis,
   where readings exceed 180/120 mmHg, is a medical emergency.
   Current evidence-based guidelines recommend early detection and management of raised blood
   pressure through a combination of lifestyle modifications and, when necessary, pharmacological
   reatment. Lifestyle recommendations include reducing sodium intake, engaging in regular physical
   activity, maintaining a healthy weight, limiting alcohol, and managing stress. Monitoring should be
   regular, especially in populations at higher risk, such as older adults or those with a family history of
   hypertension…
