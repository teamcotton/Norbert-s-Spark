- [ ] Body composition
- [ ] Factors that affect health and skill-related fitness
- [ ] The principles of training
- [ ] Fitness considerations for special populations

## What does ‘exercise’ mean and what is ‘physical fitness’?

Expertise is structured or planned activity that requires physical effort, with the aim of sustaining or improving physical fitness

**Skill-related components: **Speed, power, reaction time, coordination, agility and balance

**Physical fitness:** ‘A state of wellbeing that provides optimal performance’

**Health-related components:**  
Muscular endurance, cardiovascular fitness, flexibility, muscular strength, body composition

## Health-related components of fitness: Cardiovascular (CV) fitness

- [ ] Cardiovascular (CV) fitness: The ability of the heart, lungs and muscles to take in, transport and utilise oxygen during exercise
- [ ] It is also referred to as cardiorespiratory fitness, stamina and aerobic fitness
- [ ] CV activities increase heart rate and breathing rate, to speed up blood flow and deliver more oxygen to the body to produce aerobically
- [ ] Activities that improve CV fitness:

1. Use the large muscles of the body in a continuous way
2. Elevate the heart rate to an appropriate intensity
3. Including walking, swimming, running, cycling, rowing and dancing

## Health related components of fitness: muscular strength and endurance

**Muscular endurance (high reps, low resistance):**

The definition of muscular endurance is: the ability of the muscles to work continuously under low-to-moderate resistance

Daily activities that require muscular endurance include carrying shopping, climbing stairs, maintaining optimal posture, gardening and exercise sessions involving high-repetition resistance training

**Muscular strength (low reps, high resistance)**

The definition of muscular strength is: the ability of the muscle to exert maximal force against a high resistance

Strength-focused activities require the lifting of heavier resistance or weights for a lower number of repetitions: usually fewer than ten. Examples of activities requiring maximal strength include heavy weight lifting and moving heavy objects.

Muscular strength is useful for two key reasons: enabling people to produce a greater maximal force when required, ie moving a piece of furniture, and minimising the amount of effort required to perform everyday sub-maximal tasks to inhaling an individuals level of strength

**Health related components of fitness: Flexibility**

- [ ] Flexibility: The range of movement at a joint or series of joints
- [ ] Determined by the shape of the bones and cartilage and the length of the muscles and connective tissues (ligaments and tendons) that cross of the joint
- [ ] The amount of muscle tension is also affected by the nervous system, which determines muscle tone
- [ ] Flexibility can very enormously from one person to another
- [ ] Individuals need to develop and maintain appropriate levels of flexibility to ensure an appropriate range of motion (ROM) and freedom of movement of all joints

## Flexibility-related issues

**Immobility**

A significant lack of flexibility can dramatically affect posture and force production at a joint, and can impair performance and daily functioning. Inactivity can lead to muscle shortening and loss of flexibility (sedentary living or when a body part has been immobilised in a plaster cast)

Certain sports may reduce flexibility, ie jogging, football, boxing and hockey all involve movements where muscles are not worked through their full range. This can lead to muscle tightness and adaptive shortening. Imbalanced exercise programmes that overdevelop one muscle group (prime movers) while neglecting the opposing muscle group (antagonists) can also cause muscle imbalances that restrict flexibility

**Hypermobility**

A high degrees of flexibility or ‘hypermobility’ (sometimes erroneously referred to as being ‘double-jointed’) may lead to reduced joint stability and an increased incidence of injury

Examples of activities that require good flexibility include dance, yoga, gymnastics and martial arts; there are also certain daily activities that require the body to bend, twist and move through extended ranges of motion

**Body composition**

- [ ] Body composition: The proportion of fat and fat-free mass
- [ ] Normally measure as a percentage of body fat, which can be used to gauge health
- [ ] People of the same weight can have different body compositions
- [ ] Muscular tissue takes up less pace in the body than fat tissue and this influences how lean people appear
- [ ] The point at which body fat becomes a health risk varies between ethnic and age groups
- [ ] Many athletes and sportspeople have a body fat percentage below the generically recommended healthy levels
- [ ] Optimal levels of body fat for performance in many sports are about 7-19% for men and 10-25% for women
- [ ] Body fat percentages viewed as satisfactory for optimal health are 21-36% for women and 8-25% for men

## Skill-related components of fitness (motor skills)

- [ ] **Speed: **Speed defines how quickly a movement can be performed in a short space of time. Speed is required for many sporting events, including sprinting and throwing
- [ ] **Power:** Power is the ability to exert maximum muscular contraction instantly in an explosive burst of movement (within a short time frame). The two components of power are strength and speed. Sporting activities requiring jumping (high jump or long jump), throwing (shot put or javelin) and sprinting out of the starting blocks (a sprint start)
- [ ] **Reaction time:** Reaction time is the ability to respond quickly to a stimulus. It is important in many sports and day-to-day activities. ’Simple reaction time’ is taken between a stimulus and movement
- [ ] **Coordination:** Coordination is the ability to smoothly move two or more body parts under control, accurately and efficiently. It involves use of the sense (eyes and ear). Most activities require some form of coordination; these include performing choreographed dance or gymnastic routines, throwing, catching, (eye-to-ball coordination), kicking and hitting (ie golf swings or kicking a football)
- [ ] **Balance:** Balance is the ability to control the body’s position when stationary (ie handstand or a yoga position) or while moving (ie a spring board diver during take-off)
- [ ] **Agility: **Agility is the ability to change the position of the body and move in different directions quickly, ie zigzag running and moving through and around a field of players in a team sports

## Factors that affect health and skill related fitness: age

**General age-related considerations**

A person’s fitness is generally greatest during their 20s and declines with age. For older adults, changes to the body system - which progressively result in weaker muscles, lighter bones, stiffer joints, slower reflexes and an increase in body fat - will reduce training potential. Benefits can still be achieved, but the rate at which developments occur will be slightly slower. Age-related changes generally begin to occur at the age of 50 and make their mark at around 65. The onset of the ageing process and the rate of decline are influenced (and can be offset) by regular physical activity and exercise

**Effects of age on flexibility**

People are usually more flexible when they are younger. Babies and infants are very flexible and start to lose this natural flexibility as soon they start to walk (when the joints become weight-bearing and need more stability). As people get older, muscle contractility remains, but elasticity is lost, resulting in tighter, stiffer muscles. This may also be influenced by activity levels, which tend to decrease as people get older

**Effects, of age on activity levels**

Activity levels also reduce progressively with age in both men and women. An estimated 30% of people aged over 65 are classed as being inactive (less than 30 minutes of physical activity per week), compared to 15% of 6-24 year olds). By the age of 75, it is estimated that only 36% meet the recommended activity guideline. Reduced activity levels lead to a loss of mobility and independence, and to increased isolation

## Factors that affect health and skill-related fitness: Gender

- [ ] **Hormones: **Increased levels of testosterone during puberty mean that active males grow stronger due to a greater increase in muscle mass
- [ ] **Cardiovascular potential:** Men are generally larger than women. They have longer bones, large muscles, larger hearts and larger lungs which give them greater potential for transporting oxygen and developing their cardiovascular fitness
- [ ] **Body composition:** Males generally have a lower percentage of body fat and higher levels of muscle mass than females. Females need higher levels of body fat to equip them for pregnancy and childbirth. Reducing body fat below recommended levels would diminish levels of female hormone (oestrogen) and may cause cessation of the menstrual cycle. This in turn would contribute to to lower levels of calcium in the bones and may increase of osteoporosis in later life
- [ ] **Skeletal frame: **The female pelvis is wider and deeper in order to support pregnancy and childbirth. The Q angle (quadriceps angle) of the female pelvis is also greater, which gives women a biomechanics disadvantage when running or squatting. It also leads to an inward rotation of the knees. There differences may also influence speed; females have to move their legs a wider angle, which potentially reduces speed
- [ ] **Flexibility:** Females of all ages tend to be more flexible than males. This may be due to specificity of training they take part in, but may also be attributed to structural and anatomical differences

## Factors that affect health and skill related fitness: Heredity

**General considerations**

Physically inherited characteristics may include eye colour, skin colour and hair texture. They may also include things like body type and muscle fibre type, which will have a greater influence on training potential. An individual who inherits an ectomorphic (tall and thin) body type and a larger percentage of slow twitch muscle fibres will be more suited to long-distance endurance activities than an individual who inherits a mesomorphic (muscular) body type and a greater percentage of fast twitch muscle fibres. Training potential and goals need to be considerate of the inherited characteristics.

Various health conditions are believed to have a genetic (family) risk components (ie cardiovascular disease)

**Effects on flexibility**

Some people are born with a naturally greater (sometimes excessive) range of movement known as hyper mobility. Hypermobility can increase the potential for injury (ie joint dislocation) and it may be necessary to concentrate on strengthening the muscles acting over the joint to increase stability

## Effects on exercise progression

Each individual has a genetic potential that defines how far their fitness could progress if training, nutrition and recovery optimised

The deconditioned novice has a large potential because they are starting from a point far below their genetic limits. As a result of this and their unfamiliarity with the exercise stimulus, almost any programme will work for an untrained individual. This adaptation potential enables beginners to make rapid progress in the early stages of their training. Over time, and as they get closer to their genetic potential, the rate of progress will slow down.

Factors that affect health and skill related fitness: Physique or body body type

**There are three different body types:**

**Ectomorphs**  
Ectomorphs are naturally thin with little body fat or muscle mass. They find it difficult to gain weight (either muscle or fat). They have long levers and light body frames, which make them more suited to weight bearing aerobic activities, such as long-distance running. Their light body frame means that their joints will bear comparatively less body weight

**Mesomorphs**  
Mesomorphs tend to be naturally lean and muscular with broad shoulders and a narrow waist and hips Mesomorphs are naturally athletic and tend to be suited to a wide range of sporting activities, especially those requiring a good power-to-weight ratio, ie sprinting, hurdling and jumping

**Endomorphs**  
Endomorphs are naturally predisposed to fat storage. They tend to be apple or pear shaped and carry large amounts of body fat. Endomorphs also tend to process a reasonable degree of muscle mass, but that is often overlooked due to the predisposition for fat storage. Higher levels of body fat increase their potential to float in water, but also place additional stress on the weight-bearing joints during high-impact and weight-bearing activities. Endomorphs may be suited to activities such as the shot put or hammer throwing.

## Lifestyle factors that affect health and skill-related fitness

**Activity level**

Inactivity and sedentary living pose an increased risk of poor health. Regular non-structured physical activities, such as walking the dog, cycling and gardening can make significant improvements in maintaining health if performed on a daily basis. They key message from the Department of Health is to sit down less and move more often

Active people and people who exercise regularly generally have greater mobility and flexibility than sedentary individuals. This may depend on the type of exercise and activity they perform, ie performing lots of resistance training exercises with a limited range of movement and higher loads may actually decrease range of movement

**Diet **

The body needs specific nutrients for energy, growth and repair. These nutrients are provided by the food eaten in the diet. A healthy, balanced diet will help to ensure that the body is functioning optimally. An unhealthy diet negatively affect health and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and other chronic heath conditions

**Alcohol and proscribed drugs**

Prescribed and reaction drugs will affect exercise and fitness potential

Prescribed medications used to treat chrome health conditions often have side effects that influence the exercise response. Clients using prescribed medication should be supervised by an appropriately qualified instructor

Recreational drugs all have negative effects on health and an impact on exercise performance

Cigarettes contain carbon monoxide, which reduces the potential to take in and use oxygen. Alcohol affects the nervous system, disrupting balance and coordination, which reduces the safety of exercise, especially if the person is using equipment. Caffeine is a stimulant and may offer a short-term boost to performance. However, in the long-term, excess caffeine intake can contribute to health conditions including increased blood pressure, anxiety, depression and osteoporosis

## Other factors that affect health and skill-related fitness

**Physical disabilities**

People who have disabilities are able to exercise and do not have to be inactive. A physical impairment may prevent a specific part of the body from functioning or moving in a certain way, but exercise can be adapted and modified to enable participation, promote inclusion and improve health and fitness. Many disabled people are first-class athletes. We will be looking at exercise consideration for working disabled clients later in this section

**Illness and fatigue**

During temporary illness (cold, flu) the recommendation is to rest the body rather than exercise. Exercising with a fever (febrile illness) is a contraindicated and places stress on the body systems. All clinical symptoms should have passed before returning to exercise and it may be necessary to start at a lower level before building up.

When the body is tired (through working too hard or insufficient rest between sessions) performance diminishes and this may hinder potential training gains. It may be necessary to review training plans and also eating behaviour to balance energy requirements.

Chronic health conditions also affect exercise potential and require exercises to be modified prior to participation. A client who is obese, for example, may need to perform low-impact or non-weight-bearing activities, ie swimming or cycling. A client with high blood pressure may need to exercise at a lower intensity

NB: Clients with chronic conditions should be supervised by an appropriately qualified (Level 3 Exercise Referral) instructor or a Level 4 specialist instructor

**Pregnancy**

During both the pre and postnatal periods, there are significant changes to the female body that affect exercise potential

During pregnancy, women produce higher amounts of hormone called relaxin to assist the birth process. Relaxin affects a number of ligaments, including those in the pelvis, allowing greater flexibility than normal and potentially reducing joint stability

We will looking at exercise considerations for working with pregnant clients later in this section

## Other factors that can affect health and skill-related fitness

**Stress**

High levels of prolonged stress can lead to many other chronic health conditions including high blood pressure, coronary heart disease and depression. It will have a negative impact on person’s overall wellbeing and enjoyment of life.

Exercise and activity can assist with stress management. They provide an outlet for managing the physical tension caused by stress and a distraction for the mind, which can reduce mental strain. Exercise in the outdoors and in natural environments can have further positive effects on mood and wellbeing

**Environment**

Exercise safety can be affected by the environment. The quality of air taken in will determine the amount of oxygen that can be utilised. Aerobic fitness can be signficantly influenced by:

1. Fumes from traffic and factories
2. Altitude, ie air is thinner at high altitudes and individuals need to breathe harder to get enough oxygen

**Weather conditions**

The weather and temperature may also affect exercise use poor weather conditions, as a reason not to exercise. In most weather conditions and temperatures, exercise may need to be modified; in hot temperatures intensity may need to be reduced. In cold environments it may be necessary to lengthen the warm-up and wear additional clothing to prevent heat heat loss or wind chill

## Key principles of training

- [ ] Progressive overload
- [ ] Specificity
- [ ] Reversibility
- [ ] Recovery time
- [ ] Adaptability
- [ ] Individuality

### Specificity

- [ ] Any change or adaption in the body’s muscles, organs and systems will be very specific to the type of training (stress or stimulus) undertaken
- [ ] Exercise that develop and improve each component of fitness bring about specific adaptions, ie stretching exercises improve flexibility, they won’t develop CV fitness
- [ ] Different types of exercise that improve the same component of fitness also have have specific effects
- [ ] If the aim is to achieve a specific fitness objective, consider:

1. The predominant energy system and muscle fibre type used for the activity or sport
2. The main prime movers recruited and joint actions required
3. The joint angle and ROM used
4. The type of muscle contraction (concentric or eccentric) and speed of movement

**THE SAID Principle**  
The body specifically adapts to the training demands on it  
**Specific**  
**Adaptions**  
**to**  
**Imposed**  
**Demand**

### Progressive overload

- [ ] Increasing speed
- [ ] Increasing duration
- [ ] Increasing resistance
- [ ] Increasing the number of reps
- [ ] Increasing the number of sets
- [ ] Decreasing recovery time between sets
- [ ] Increasing the number of sessions
- [ ] Increasing the effect of gravity, ie wall press-up to floor press-up
- [ ] Decreasing stability, ie sit-up to core ball sit-up

Note The stimulus must be enough to challenge and evoke the required adaption. The level of overload applied will be determined by the current fitness of the individual and their goals. An untrained, sedentary person may need comparatively small changes to bring abut a training effect, whereas a trained individual may need a greater challenge

### Reversibility - ‘use it or lose it’

- [ ] Improvements in fitness can only be achieved through regular exercise and activity; if the exercise stops, the improvements will gradually decline
- [ ] The rate of decline is determined by

1. Individual fitness levels
2. The level of stimulus reduction (ie total cessation or reduced volume)
3. The length of time for which the stimulus is reduced

- [ ] Total inactivity or lack of movement for extended time periods contributes to an increased risk of many chronic health conditions
- [ ] To maintain optimal function, all body systems need to be trained regularly at an appropriate volume

### Adaptability

- [ ] The body reacts and adapts in accordance with the type of challenge and overload to which it is subjected.  
       For example:

1. High-resistance and low-repetition exercise can lead to an increase in muscular strength
2. Intense exercise (lasting under ten seconds), ie sprints or maximal strength training, can cause adaptions in the ATP/CP systems, making them more efficient
3. Lower-intensity, longer-duration activities help to improve aerobic endurance by increasing the efficiency of the aerobic energy system (CV endurance

- [ ] Adaptability can only happen if progressive overload is factored into exercise

NOTE: Learn FITT principles

Frequency (how often you train), Intensity (how hard you train), Time (how long you train), and Type (the kind of exercise you do)

### Overtraining

If overtraining is suspected, try or or two the following regressions:

- [ ] Increase the rest time between sets
- [ ] Reduce frequency of training
- [ ] Reduce the weight lifted on certain exercises (decrease resistance)
- [ ] Reduce the duration of the total session
- [ ] Change high-impact activities to low-impact activities
- [ ] Change exercise complexity by choosing simpler exercises (less complex equipment)

Signs and symptoms of overtraining

- [ ] Reduction in performance
- [ ] Sudden loss of coordination
- [ ] Lack of ability to concentrate
- [ ] Irritability and oversensitivity to criticism
- [ ] Reported disrupted sleep patterns
- [ ] General lethargy
- [ ] Susceptibility to colds and illness

### Individuality

An individual’s training can be influenced by

- [ ] Current strength
- [ ] Skill level coordination
- [ ] Gender
- [ ] Goals
- [ ] Physiological characteristics
- [ ] Heredity
- [ ] Age
- [ ] CV fitness
- [ ] Body fitness

### The FITT principles

**Frequency of training: **How often the activity will be performed

**Intensity of training:** How hard the activities will be

**Time or duration: **how long the activities will be performed

**Type of training:** the specific activities that will be performed, ie strength, endurance, walking, running, Pilates

### Frequency

**The client’s fitness level:**

An untrained, inactive individual can start by gradually increasing their daily activity levels, so that they are eventually active at a moderate intensity on five more days of the week. Scheduled exercise sessions for a beginner may be planned on two to three non-consecutive days a week (with a rest in between each session)

Competitive athletes may train up to 12 times a week, with morning and evening sessions on many days; different muscles and fitness components will be focused in different sessions

**Component of fitness**

Frequency of training also depends on the component of the fitness training. It is safe to stretch every day if the muscle are warm, but for muscular strength and endurance training, 48 hours rest is recommended prior to working the same muscle groups. Training for specific muscles should therefor be planned on non-consecutive days. If different muscle groups are worked on different days (ie split routine), muscular training can be more frequent.

**Exercise intensity**

Another key factor that affects frequency is the intensity of the exercise. Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise can be performed more often (every day), with less risk of injury. Vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise carries a higher risk of injury and therefore may need to be performed less frequently

**Intensity**

###

- [ ] The intensity if exercise will be determined by:

1. Individual factors
2. Goals and components of fitness trained

- [ ] The intensity of CV exercise gauged using heart rate or rate of perceived exertion (RPE)
- [ ] The intensity of flexibility exercise is gauged using ROM
- [ ] The intensity of muscle strength and endurance training is gauged according to resistance lifted and the number of repetitions
- [ ] Intensity for specific components of fitness can be changed by alerting:

1. Resistance, including lever length, gravity and body weight
2. Number of repetitions
3. ROM
4. Rest
5. Number of sets

## Time

**One-to-one training sessions**

The minimum duration of training to improve CV fitness is around 20-30 minutes, excluding the warm-up and cool-down

For muscular fitness training, sufficient time must be allocated to train all major groups and perform the planned sets and repetitions of each specific exercise

The time allocated for stretching should be sufficient to incorporate all major muscle groups for the appropriate number of seconds

**Group exercise sessions**

Group exercise sessions (exercise in water, outdoor boot camps, Pilate and yoga) tend to be planned for a set duration - usually a minimum of 45 minutes and a maximum of 90 minutes - which includes a warm-up and preparatory exercises and a cool-down and closing phase exercises

**Gym-based sessions**

Gym-based sessions are planned with similar time frames to group sessions (between 45 and 120 minutes), including a warm-up and cool-down. The time allocated for the main workout will depend on the components of fitness trained (CV training only, muscular fitness training only or both) and the time required for each component. For example, a circuit weight training session integrating CV and muscular exercises may require less time than a strength-based resistance programme using more sets and longer rests between sets

### Type

**Gym-based exercise tends to involve:**

- [ ] CV machines
- [ ] Free resistance machines
- [ ] Free weights
- [ ] Portable equipment
- [ ] Body weight

**Group based exercise tends to involve **

- [ ] Body weight
- [ ] Light free weights
- [ ] Portable equipment
- [ ] Mats
- [ ] Specialised class equipment

## Special populations

Specialist populations include:

- [ ] Older adults
- [ ] Pre and postnatal women
- [ ] Young people (aged 14-16)
- [ ] Disabled people

## Older adults

Older adult: An individual over the age of 65, or over 55 with at least 1 clinically significant health condition or physical limitation

- [ ] The ageing process is characterised by progressive loss and decline in the functioning of the skeletal, cardiovascular, respiratory and neuromuscular systems
- [ ] These changes affect fitness potential and safety during exercise and require adaptions to be made to meet specific needs
- [ ] Ageing often begins to take effect around the age of 50, with signs noticeable around the age of 65
- [ ] It can lead to reduced mobility, loss of independence, increased frailty and heightened risk of falls and bone fractures
- [ ] People of the same age may not have the same loss of functioning; activity levels and lifestyle habits can delay or accelerate the onset of the ageing process

**The effects of ageing on the body**

- [ ] Ageing brings about a 1-2% decline in physical capacity each year
- [ ] Functional declines (ie loss of flexibility, agility and mobility) make everyday activities harder to perform; these changes may explain the reduction of activity levels associated with ageing
- [ ] Getting older involves a longevity of exposure too risk factors for some chronic health conditions, including:

1. Increased joint wear-and-tear (osteoarthritis)
2. Loss of bone mass (osteoporosis)
3. Atherosclerosis (hypertension and coronary heart disease)

- [ ] Contraindications to exercise include:

1. Unstable or uncontrolled conditions (ie diabetes, asthma or angina)
2. Resting blood pressure of more than 180/110mmHg
3. Resting heart rate over 100bpm (tachycardia)

- [ ] Emphasise correct technique
- [ ] Layer information (impart it in stages rather than all at once)

**Muscular training**

- [ ] Use less resistance and shorter leverage for some exercises
- [ ] Use fewer repetitions and sets, and more rest
- [ ] Use more stable and balanced positions
- [ ] Allow transition time to get down and up from the floor
- [ ] Use a slower pace
- [ ] Allow more time to change exercises or positions
- [ ] Emphasise correct technique
- [ ] Supine lying may be contraindicated (osteoporosis); extreme spinal flexion (ie full or half curl-ups from supine position) may also be contraindicated (consider alternatives)
- [ ] Strengthen postural muscles, pelvic floor muscles and areas around potential fracture sites for osteoporosis (wrist, hip, and spine)

**Cool-down and closing**

**Postnatal adoptions to session content**

- [ ] Exercise shouldn’t start until the healthcare professional permits it - usually at the 6-8 week postpartum check
- [ ] Before progressing to more vigorous exercise, the focus should be:

1. Re-educating posture and joint alignment
2. Address muscle imbalances
3. Improving stability and motor skills
4. Encouraging transversus abadominis recruitment and pelvic floor function

- [ ] Medical referral should be sought in the event of:

1. Stress incontinence or pelvic floor muscle weakness
2. Dragging pain or a feeling of heaviness in the lower abdominal or pelvic floor area
3. Groin pain, low back pain or difficulty walking, even if it is mild and intermittent
4. Adominal muscle weakness, excessive abdominal doming, abdominal muscle separation, softness or sinking at the umbilical midline or umbilical hernia

Session and structure and content for postnatal clients

**Warm-up and preparation**

- [ ] Emphasise correct posture at the start and throughout the session
- [ ] Make movements slower and more controlled
- [ ] Increase the number of mobility exercises
- [ ] Use full ROM mobility exercises to warm the muscles
- [ ] Build up intensity of movements much more gradually to avoid sudden increases in blood pressure
- [ ] Support stretch positions and take care not to exceed a comfortable ROM\

**Cardiovascular training**

- [ ] Use low to moderate intensity
- [ ] Use low impact
- [ ] Use a more gradual build-up and lowering of intensity
- [ ] Use less choreography (group exercise to music)
- [ ] Use a slower tempo
- [ ] Women who are unused to exercie should start with shorter durations (being with 15 minutes and increase gradually to 30 minutes)
- [ ] Maintain adequate hydration
- [ ] Avoid exercising in very hot or humid conditions
- [ ] Avoid heart rate monitoring - use verbal and visual methods or monitoring intensity

**Muscular fitness**

- [ ] Include exercises for the pelvic floor muscles
- [ ] Select comfortable starting positions
- [ ] Avoid exercises which may place too much pressure on the pelvic girdle
- [ ] Use movements related to everyday life
- [ ] Perform fewer repetitions
- [ ] Use lower-intensity exercises
- [ ] Do not use heavy abdominal exercises, ie sit-up, crunch or oblique cross-over type exercises are not an appropriate choice for abdominal muscle reeducation post birth

**Cool down and closing**

- [ ] Include specific relaxation work
- [ ] Avoid positions which may overstretch the ligaments
- [ ] Select balanced and comfortable positions for passive stretching
- [ ] Use shorter-hold stretches to maintain rather than develop flexibility

## Disabled people

There are around 8-10 million disabled people in the UK  
Examples of disabilities include:

- [ ] Blindness or partial sightedness
- [ ] Deafness or partial hearing
- [ ] Down’s syndrome
- [ ] Stroke
- [ ] Obesity
- [ ] Arthritic conditions
- [ ] Mental health conditions
- [ ] Cancer
- [ ] HIV
- [ ] Limb amputation
- [ ] Fibromyalgia
- [ ] Cerebral palsy

### Benefits and barriers to activity

- [ ] Regular physical activity will reduce the risk of developing chronic health conditions and can help to maintain and improve independence
- [ ] Disabled people are one of the populations identified as not meeting recommended levels of physical activity
- [ ] Many disabled people experience access-related barriers to physical exercise
- [ ] Service providers are obliged by law to make reasonable adjustments to accommodate the needs of disabled clients
- [ ] The Inclusive Fitness Initiative (IFI) provides guidance and support for service operators and disabled people who wish to become active
- [ ] This guidance is provided in line with their policies

Safety considerations for working with disabled clients

Exercise selection: This will be determined by specific needs and may include:

1. Simplifying some exercise
2. Reducing intensity (fewer repetitions, lower resistance, appropriate range of motion, controlled rate
3. Modifying exercise positions and modalities, ie using wheelchair-based activities for wheelchair uses or chair based activities with physical or functional limitations or issues with balance

Teaching style: Teaching style and methods will need to be accommodate specific needs and may include:

1. Clarity of verbal instructions for the blind or visually impaired
2. Clarity of demonstrations; facing the person and speaking clearly when instructing the deaf or those with partial hearing (ie to enable lip-reading)
3. Finding appropriate ways to engage and encourage people with learning disabilities, ie Down’s syndrome

Health and safety: This would include consideration of entry and access to all facilities; safe evacuation procedures in emergencies and respect for other legislation, ie safeguarding vulnerable adults

**Exercise considerations**

**Progressive disorders**: These conditions worsen over time, ie multiple sclerosis. Careful monitoring is required to ensure that the exercise programme does not cause the condition to worsen

**Spasticity**: Many physical disabilities present with spasticity muscles that are very tight or rigid. Flexibility training is important. However before they incorporate any flexibility into a programme, the instructor must seek advice from a suitably trained medical authority on how to stretch a spastic muscle without causing injury

**Asymmetircal weakness:** These conditions result in a difference in strength between the left and right sides of the body, ie stroke and cerebral palsy. The aim should be to improve the affected side as much as possible without neglecting the unaffected side. If the nerves controlling the affected side have been partially or completely damaged, the opportunity for improvement in the local muscles is greatly reduced

**Neuromuscular disorders**: These affect the central nervous system (CNS), ie muscular dystrophy. Muscules can become progressively weaker as a result of the decline in CNS functioning; this can be offset in the programme by working on general fitness levels. Any rapid decline in function would necessitate immediate referral to the GP for guidance

**Sensory nerve damage**: Damage to sensory nerves occurs with many types of physical disability. An inability to detect pressure increases the risk of developing pressure sores and clients will usually be aware of the importance of frequent checks. The use of gym equipment many bring similar risks, so additional checks should be advised

**Depression**: This is a disabling condition in its own right. It can sometimes be a secondary condition resulting from the physical and psychological challenges of living with a disability. Depression reduces motivation and energy levels, and can contribute to drop-out from the programme. Medications used to treat depression have many negative side effects, including weight gain and suicide risk

## Young people (aged 14-16):

Exercise considerations for working with young people

**Flexibility:** During the growth spurt, there is an increased injury risk because the soft tissue around the joints is already stretched, as muscle does not keep up with bone growth

Caution should be taken when teaching any stretch exercise. The aim should be to strerch only to the point of mild tension and to avoid

**Technique: **Young adults not generally developed their body awareness and coordination. They required close supervision to ensure correct alignment. To reduce risk of injury, begin with non-complex, low-resistance exercises and, where possible, use movement patterns that replicate everyday activities. Progression should only be applied when technique is correct

**Growth plate fractures:** The growth plate is the weakest area of the growing skeleton. Growth plate fractures account for up to 15% of all childhood fractures, with the highest level of incidence among 14-16 year old boys and 11-13 year old girls. A serious injury to a joint is more likely to damage the growth plate Than the ligaments around it

Preventative measures to avoid growth-related injuries include:

- [ ] Avoiding excessive training; this includes playing too much of one sport, playing the wrong sport for the young person’s body type of using a resitance that is too heavy
- [ ] Considering gender differences and the differing stages of development
- [ ] Avoiding inappropriate size-matching in pair activities
- [ ] Avoiding too much static, high-impact activity, ie jogging on the spot
- [ ] Warming up and cooling down throughly
- [ ] Using appropriate equipment for the activity, ie correct size and weight

**Limb length:** During growth spurt, young people have disproportionately long legs, meaning that they are biomechanically out of balance and are potentially less coordinated

**Gym equipment: **The resistance machines in most gyms are designed for adult users and the weight increments are generally too great for young people. Free weights can be better choice because they allow smaller weight increase and their safe and effective use is not dependent on the size of the exerciser. Care should be taken to ensure correct technique.

**Cardiovascular and cardiorespiratory considerations for 14-16 year olds**

**Cardiovascular:** Young adults have smaller heart chambers and lower heart volumes. This results in a lower stroke volume at rest during excerise. Chamber size and blood volume gradually increase with body growth. The lower stroke volume is counterbalanced by higher maximal heart rates. However, higher heart rates maximal cannot fully compensate for the lower stroke volume and so cardiac output (volume of blood pumped from the left ventricle in one minute) is lower

Young adults generally have lower blood pressure than adults, mainly because they have not been exposed to the risk factors affecting blood for so long (longevity effects)

**Respiratory considerations:** Lung volume and peak flow rates steadily increase until full growth. For example, maximum ventilation increases from 40L/min at 5 years of age to more than 110L/min as an adult. This means that children and young people have higher respiratory rates than adults - 60 breathes per minute compares to 40 breaths per minute for the equivalent level of exercise

The measure of the amount of ventilation (passage of air in and out of the lungs) required for each litre of oxygen consumed (VE/VO2) is also higher in young people, which means that children have inferior pulmonary functions.

Children and young people’s arterial/venous oxygen difference is greater and this suggests that a higher percentage of the cardiac goes to the working muscles than for an adult; this is another way in which children and young adults compensate for their lower stroke volume

**Aerobic capacity:** Aerobic capacity in young people is higher in absolute terms: VO2max (measure in L/min) increases from the ages of 6-18 for boy and 6-14 for girls. However, little change is observed with age when VO2max is normalised body weight. There is a slight decline after puberty in girls because of the increase in body rather than muscle mass. By contrast, V02max does not limit endurance performance. Young people more often lack technique and coordination and end up with poor economy of movement in activities such as running

**Anaerobic exercise**

- [ ] Anaerobic capacity is fully developed at the age of 20
- [ ] Young people have less glycogen stored per gram of muscle
- [ ] They have fewer stores of creatine phosphate
- [ ] They have a lower anaerobic work level and should work at a low-to-moderate intensity
- [ ] Activities to avoid until they reach physical and skeletal maturity:

1. Power lifting
2. Bodybuilding
3. Maximal resistance lifts

### Body temperature and dehydration

- [ ] Young people have an inferior cooling mechanism due to low bloody and higher skin temperature
- [ ] They are sensitive to heat stress because they expand more energy per kilogram of bodyweight than an adult during exercise
- [ ] Adolescents are at risk of dehydration when exercising, due to overheating
- [ ] In the cold, they lose heat more quickly due to their relatively large surface compared to their mass

## Summary of the key safety considerations for working with young people

**Growth-related issues and injuries: **Lower impact and intensity (fewer repetitions, less and avoid overtraining

**Flexibility: **Modify stretch positions, stretch to the point of mild tension (without overstretching), modify ROM and focus on correct technique. Avoid ballistic stretching

**Medical conditions: **The presence of any medical conditions would necessitate signposting to a GP prior to participation

**Obesity:** This may present with the CVD risk factors (inactivity, hypertension, high cholesterol or diabetes) that negatively affect health. Sufferers need to be signposted to a GP prior to participation

**Temperature:** Maintain hydration, lower intensity and avoid exercise in humid conditions

**Self-esteem and confidence:** Be mindful of any lack of confidence and low self-esteem, and how this may affect behaviour and motivation. Body image issues may be apparent (eating disorders would constitute a contraindiction for exercise.

**Immaturity:** This may affect behaviour and regard for safety

**Reduced coordination and motor skills:** Simpler and non-complex activities with less technical demand would be recommended. Focus on exercise technique and adapt your teaching style to meet the client’s needs

## FITT requirements for working with young people

**Frequency**  
Aerobic: every day  
Strength: three days a week  
Bone strengthening: three days a week

**Intensity**  
Moderate to vigorous intensity aerobic exercise

**Time**  
60 minutes

**Type**  
CV: swimming, dancing, cycling, running or walking  
Strength: climbing trees, games (ie: tug of war) and resistance exercises  
Bone strengthening: Jumping, running, skipping, hop scotch and games (basketball, tennis)

I'm using TypeScript 5.9.3 and I'm not seeing any errors:

````typescript
const fileBuffer = fs.readFileSync('../test-data/uuid-v7.txt')
   const keePassFileBuffer: ArrayBuffer = fileBuffer.buffer
   type result = typeof keePassFileBuffer```

The result type is ArrayBuffer


	"description": "A small TypeScript library to obscure sensitive data in logs, error messages, and debugging output",


using the above when running tests I receive the following error:


FAIL  src/obscured.test.ts [ src/obscured.test.ts ]
ReferenceError: ObscuredBrand is not defined
 ❯ src/obscured.ts:30:15
     28| export class Obscured<T> implements ObscuredValue<T> {

       |               ^
     31|  static readonly PLACEHOLDER = "[OBSCURED]";

I have been told: The issue was that you can't use a declare const symbol as a computed property key in a class because it doesn't exist at runtime.

I want to change the test suite from node native to Vitest with three different configurations that allows successful runs against: three JavaScript runtimes: Node.js, Browser (Chromium), and Bun.



“Never Play Loud Trumpets Before Bed, Andrew”

Never → Nose/Mouth
Play → Pharynx
Loud → Larynx
Trumpets → Trachea
Before → Bronchi
Bed → Bronchioles
Andrew → Alveoli

1. Mnemonic for Respiratory Muscles
Primary muscle of breathing: Diaphragm

Mnemonic: “D = Draws air Down”

When the Diaphragm contracts, it moves Down, drawing air In.

Intercostal muscles

Mnemonic: “External = Expand, Internal = Inward”

External intercostals → Expand the ribcage (inhalation)

Internal intercostals → move ribs Inward (forced exhalation)

Together:
“D-EEI” → Diaphragm, External = Expand, Internal = Inward

🫀 2. Mnemonic for Gas Exchange

Gas exchange happens in the alveoli.
Mnemonic: “O2 IN, CO2 OUT” → “In-Out Alveoli”

Or a full mnemonic:

“Alveoli: O goes In, CO₂ goes Out” (A-O-O)

Alveoli

Oxygen goes Onward into blood

CO₂ goes Out into alveolar air

OR shorter:

“AIOO — Alveoli In Oxygen, Out CO₂”
🌬 3. Mnemonic for Inhaled vs Exhaled Air
Composition of inhaled air: 21-0-78

Mnemonic: “O-CO-N” → Oxygen, Carbon dioxide, Nitrogen

Oxygen ≈ 21%

CO₂ ≈ 0.04%

Nitrogen ≈ 78%

Composition of exhaled air: 16-4-78

Mnemonic: “O Drops, CO₂ Pops”

Oxygen drops from 21% to 16%

CO₂ pops up from 0.04% to 4–5%

Nitrogen stays the same (78%)

Even simpler:

“21→16 and 0.04→4”

I want to create a monorepo using PNPM and Turborepo. There will be two directories: frontend and backend
The frontend will use the Astro framework with React and Material UI. For code quality it will use ESlint and Prettier. It will also use the ai and streamdown NPM packages. It will use Vitest for unit tests and PlayWright for E2E test

The backend will the same quality pipeline of Eslint and Prettier with Vitest for unit tests. It will use Drizzle and @ai-sdk/google. It will self-host Supabase with docker for PostgreSQL support: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker


Add the NPM package Husky to the project. Create a commit hook that runs the 'pnpm run formatter' for prettier and then the linter and type checker. Add pre-push hook that runs the 'pnpm run formatter' for prettier and that runs linter, type checker and runs the unit tests.
