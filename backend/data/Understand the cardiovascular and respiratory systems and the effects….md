# Understand the cardiovascular and respiratory systems and the effects of exercise

This will involve:

- [ ] The cardiovascular system
- [ ] The different components of blood and their functions
- [ ] The respiratory system
- [ ] The process of gaseous exchange

The cardiovascular and respiratory systems

- [ ] The cardiovascular and respiratory systems:

1. Work together do draw oxygen
2. Transport oxygen to the tissues need it
3. Remove waste products, ie carbon dioxide

- [ ] This process is vital for the survival, maintenance and functioning of all the body’s tissues
- [ ] The cardiovascular system (circulatory system) is comprised of:

1. The heart
2. Bloody vessels
3. Blood

- [ ] It is responsible for transporting oxygen and other important nutrients to the body’s tissues, and for removing waste products

## Structure and function of the heart

- [ ] The heart is a muscular pump which pushes oxygen around the body to the tissues
- [ ] It is about the size of a man’s clenched fist
- [ ] It is a cardiac muscle, made up of think muscular walls (myocardium) and divided into two halves:

1. The right half receives form the body and pumps it to the lungs
2. The left half receives bloody from the lungs and pumps it to the body

- [ ] There are four heart chambers in total:

1. The two upper chambers (atria) receive blood from the veins
2. The two lower chambers (ventricles) pump blood into the arteries

### Heart valves

**Atria:** The atria receive blood via the veins from different parts of the body and pump it down into the ventricles. They are smaller than the ventricles and do not require high levels of pressure do to their job. Even if the atria fail to contract properly, most of the blood inside them still flows into the ventricles passively

**Ventricles**: The ventricles supply the force to push blood to its various destinations. The left ventricle has larger muscular walls than the right ventricle. This is because the left side pumps its contents to the furthest parts of the body, whereas the right side only has to pump blood to the adjacent lungs

### Blood pressure

**Bloody pressure readings**  
Blood pressure is measured in millimetres of mercury and is expressed using two numerical readings. The optimal bloody pressure reading is written as 120/80mmHg. These two numbers represent the systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respectively

**Systolic bloody pressure (SBP)**  
Systolic blood pressure is the pressure exerted on the artery walls when the cardiac muscle is contracting and pumping bloody. This is the higher of the two numbers and is usually noted first. It is caused but the rise in volume of blood flowing through the arteries with each beat, which increases the pressure within the arteries.

## Control of circulatory bloody flow

- [ ] Blood vessels have walls made of smooth muscle, which enables them to narrow (vasconstrict) or wide (vasodilator)
- [ ] This enables the body to the direct the flow of blood to different tissues (depending on its physical state and where oxygen and nutrients are required)
- [ ] It also plays a part in regulation of bloody pressure
- [ ] After a meal, the blood vessels that feed the digestive system, while blood vessels feeding the muscles are vas constricted, reducing blood flow
- [ ] During exercise, the more blood is routed to the muscles and is less available to the digestive organs and smooth muscle of the digestive tracts
- [ ] Eating a large meal too close to a training session will not allow enough time for the food to be digested in the stomach, causing cramp and sometimes vomiting

### Bloody pressure can be expressed as cardiac output X total peripheral resistance

Cardiac output is the volume of blood pumped out by the heart in one minute (ml/min). The greater the cardiac output, the higher the blood pressure

Total peripheral resistance is the resistance the blood vessels offer to blood flow. The greater the resistance, the higher the blood pressure. Peripheral resistance is increased by constriction or decreased by dilation of the blood vessels (arterioles)

### Bloody pressure readings:

Blood circulation is closed system in which the pressure varies constantly. It rises to a peak at the heart of a contraction with each heart beat as the heart pumps blood out, it then falls to a lower level which it reaches just before each heart beat. Optimal blood pressure for reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease or CDT is below 100 mmHG mercury systolic and 80 mmHG of diastolic pressure. Readings much lower than this may have some clinical significance but are not associated with increased risk. Readings above optimal level increase cardiovascular risk. Readings above 180 over 110 are something indication of exercise.

The diastolic blood pressure considered optimal is 80mmHg

### Bloody circulation

- [ ] All mammal, including humans, have a double circulatory system.
- [ ] Blood passes through the heart twice:

1. Once through the pulmonary circulation
2. Once through the systemic circulation

- [ ] Pulmonary circulation happens between the heart and lungs.

1. The pulmonary heart chambers are the left atrium and right ventricle
2. The pulmonary blood vessels are the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary vein

- [ ] Systemic circulation happens between the heart and the body:

1. The systemic heart chambers are the left ventricle and right atrium
2. The system blood vessels are the aorta and the inferior and superior vena cava. The inferior vena cava carries blood from the lower body The superior vena cava carries blood from the upper body

## Structure and function of blood vessels

**Arteries**

**Structure**

1. Thick, muscular wall
2. Subdivide into smaller blood vessels called arterioles
3. The largest artery is the aorta, which leaves the left ventricle carrying blood under the highest pressure

**Function**

1. Carry blood under high pressure away from the heart
2. All carry oxygenated blood except the pulmonary artery

**Viens**

**Structure**

1. Thinner walls than arteries with little muscle
2. Subdivide into smaller blood vessels called venues
3. Contain one-way valves to prevent blood from flowing in the wrong direction

**Function**

1. Carry blood towards the heart under low-to-moderate pressure
2. All carry deoxygenated blood except the pulmonary vein

**Capillaries **

**Structure**

1. Extremely thin walls (approximately one cell thick)
2. Link arteries to viens
3. Significantly higher in number than arteries and veins

**Function**

1. Allow for diffusion of gasses and nutrients throughout the body, including muscle tissues

## Components of blood and their function

**Red blood cells**  
Contain haemoglobin, which binds to oxygen in order to carry it around the body  
Haemoglobin is the iron-rich pigment that gives red blood cells (and therefor blood) their colour

**White blood cells**  
Part of the immune system and, therefore, fight infection. Destroy bacteria and other harmful living organisms

**Platelets**  
Assist is preventing blood loss a damaged vessel by forming a platelet plug  
Release chemicals that help to promote blood clotting; this is the initial stage of repair to damaged tissues

**Plasma**  
The straw-coloured liquid portion of the blood. Consists predominantly of water (91.5%) and solutes (8.5%), such as proteins, electrolytes, nutrients, gases, hormones, enzymes, vitamins and waste products

## The respiratory system

- [ ] The respiratory system is responsible for:

1. The intake of oxygen from the air into the body
2. The removal of carbon dioxide from the body into the air

- [ ] It consists of:

1. The lungs
2. The respiratory muscles (the diaphragm and intercostal muscles)

- [ ] It works interdependently with the circulatory system, ensuring the oxygen supply keeps the body alive and performing its daily functions
- [ ] It is essential for aerobic energy production and muscle work

**Structure and function of the lungs**

- [ ] The lungs are spongy-like structures that fill up most of the thoracic cavity (thorax) and are protected by the ribs on each side
- [ ] The lungs are separated from the abdomen by a sheet of muscle at the bottom (diagragm)
- [ ] The primary function of the lungs is gaseous exchange (receiving vital oxygen and passing it through to the circulatory system) while expelling potentially harmful waste products

### The passage of air through the respiratory tract

Nose and mouth ->  
Pharynx (throat) and larynx (voice box) ->  
Trachea ->  
Bronchi ->  
Bronchioles ->  
Alveoli

The two different mechanisms for causing the human body to breath are rising carbon dioxide in the blood and stretch receptors in respiratory muscles becoming stretched

### The main phrases of the breaking cycle are

**Inspiration**  
During inspiration, the diaphragm muscle contracts, causing the normal ‘dome shape’ to flatten. The external intercostal muscles also contract, raising the ribcage. These actions increase the chest cavity volume. This increase in volume creates a negative pressure between the air in the lungs and air in the atmosphere. This is very much like a vacuum effect in which the negative pressure sucks air into the lungs until the two pressures are balanced

**Expiration**  
During expiration, the diaphragm muscle relaxes and rises, returning upwards to its dome shape. The intercostal muscles also relax, decreasing the chest cavity volume. This creates a positive pressure, which ‘pushes’ some of the air out of the lungs

During exercise, when breathing becomes more vigorous the internal intercostal muscles become active. During expiration, they contract, forcing the ribs down and removing the air in the lungs

## Gaseous exchange

**During gaseous exchange**

Oxygen in the alveoli (air sacks in the lungs) diffuses into the bloodstream (capillaries surrounding the alveoli) and travels to the heart where it is circulated around the body.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is transported from the body via the blood. It diffuses into the alveoli where it is removed during expiration

Oxygen in the blood (travelling from the heart) diffuses into the cells (mitochondria) for aerobic energy production

Carbon dioxide from the cells diffuses into the blood where it is circulated back to the heart and then into the lungs for removal during expiration

**Diffusion**

- [ ] Diffusion: Movement of a gas from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.
- [ ] The concentration of oxygen decreases between the mouth and the lungs, therefore the gas flows in this direction (carbon dioxide flows in the opposite direction)
- [ ] Once the oxygen gets into the alveoli, it continues to diffuse into the bloodstream
- [ ] The alveolar walls and the capillary walls allow gases to pass through them:

1. Oxygen passes into the blood
2. Carbon dioxide passes back into the atmosphere lungs to be exhaled

## The combined work of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems

- [ ] Haemoglobin (Hb): Protein in red blood cells that carries, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (CO) in the blood.
- [ ] The oxygen binds to the haemoglobin in the red blood cells
- [ ] Carbon dioxide dissociates from the haemoglobin and diffuses from the blood into the alveoli in the lungs to be exhaled.
- [ ] The red blood cells are transported via the circulatory system

1. Oxygen from the lungs is carried by the red blood cells to the heart where it is pumped from the heart to the body
2. Carbon dioxide from the cells is carried by the red blood cells back to the heart and into the lungs

### The lifecycle of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems: Early years

- [ ] The cardiovascular and respiratory systems grow rapidly in the early years
- [ ] At birth, the left ventricle and the right ventricle are the same mass (weight)
- [ ] With time and exposure to high volume and pressure of blood flow, the left ventricle grows in size at a significantly higher rate; by early childhood it is double the size of the right ventricle
- [ ] A child will develop a lot of air sacs very quickly within the first six months of their life
- [ ] A baby’s breathing rate is higher (30-60 breaths per minute) than that of an adult (12-20 breaths per minute)
- [ ] By the age off three, a child’s lungs and heart look like a mini version of an adults
- [ ] From the stage onwards, the lungs get bigger as the person grows.

### The lifecycle of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems: Later life

Examples of deterioration in the cardiovascular and respiratory system are:

- [ ] Thickening and stiffening of the large arteries, which cause systolic blood pressure to rise with age, while diastolic pressure generally declines after the 6th decade
- [ ] A deadline in aerobic exercise capacity of approximately 10% per decade from the age of 40 onwards
- [ ] Changes in the shape of the ribcage, as bones become thinner and reshape, meaning it cannot expand and contract as well during breathing
- [ ] Weakening of the diaphragm, which can prevent a person enough air in or out
- [ ] A loss of function in the part of the brain that controls breathing. When this happens, the lungs are not able to get enough oxygen or expel enough carbon dioxide from the lungs, making breathing more difficult
