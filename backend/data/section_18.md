8.4 Describe how exercise can enhance
neuromuscular connections and improve motor
fitness
Introduction: Be Able to Understand the Nervous System and Its Relation to Exercise
Understanding the nervous system is essential for appreciating how the body controls movement,
coordination, and muscle activation during exercise. The nervous system sends signals between the
brain, spinal cord, and muscles, enabling precise control of physical activity. Knowledge of this system
helps fitness professionals design programmes that improve motor skills, reaction time, and overall
performance while preventing injury.
8.1 Describe the role and functions of the nervous system
8.2 Describe the principles of muscle contraction
8.3 Describe the 'all or none law'/motor unit recruitment
8.4 Describe how exercise can enhance neuromuscular connections and improve motor fitness
Begin the essay by explaining the importance of the nervous system in controlling movement and
coordinating responses to exercise. The student should define the nervous system as the body’s central
communication network, made up of the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous
system (PNS). The introduction should also briefly mention that efficient neuromuscular communication
is key to both everyday movement and athletic performance.

1. Role and Functions of the Nervous System:
   o The nervous system receives, processes, and responds to internal and external stimuli.
   o The CNS (brain and spinal cord) interprets information, while the PNS carries out
   commands to muscles.
   o Controls voluntary and involuntary movements essential to exercise.
2. Principles of Muscle Contraction:
   o Explain how muscles contract through electrical impulses sent from the brain.
   o Introduce the sliding filament theory, where actin and myosin filaments slide over each
   other, shortening the muscle.
3. 'All or None Law'/Motor Unit Recruitment:
   o Describe how a motor unit (a motor neuron and the muscle fibres it controls) works.
   o According to the all-or-none law, muscle fibres in a motor unit contract fully when
   stimulated.
   o More motor units are recruited as the demand for force increases during exercise.

4. Enhancing Neuromuscular Connections Through Exercise:
   o Regular physical activity strengthens neuromuscular pathways.
   o Improved motor fitness results in better coordination, faster reaction times, and more
   efficient movement patterns.
   Essay Snippet 8.1 – 8.4
   The nervous system is the control centre of the human body, responsible for communication between the
   brain and muscles during physical activity. It plays a vital role in movement, coordination, and
   maintaining homeostasis during exercise. The system consists of the central nervous system (CNS),
   including the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which links the CNS to the
   limbs and organs. Together, they ensure rapid and accurate transmission of signals necessary for muscle
   contraction and coordination. Muscle contraction begins when the brain sends a signal…

Be able to understand the structure and function
Assessment
of the digestive system
9.1 Outline what is meant by digestion Essay
9.2 Describe the main functions of the digestive
system
9.3 Describe the structure of the digestive system
9.4 Explain how the digestive system works to
include:
• Time scales for digestion
• How carbohydrates are absorbed
• The enzymes involved
• How the liver and pancreas assist
9.5 Explain how fluid is important for digestion
Introduction: Be Able to Understand the Structure and Function of the Digestive System
Understanding the structure and function of the digestive system is key to knowing how the body
processes food and absorbs nutrients. The digestive system includes organs such as the mouth,
stomach, intestines, liver, and pancreas, which work together to break down food, extract energy, and
eliminate waste. This knowledge helps fitness professionals appreciate the role of nutrition in
supporting exercise performance, recovery, and overall health.

9.4 Explain how the digestive system works to include:
• Time scales for digestion
• How carbohydrates are absorbed
• The enzymes involved
• How the liver and pancreas assist
9.5 Explain how fluid is important for digestion
The student should define digestion as the mechanical and chemical process by which the body breaks
down food into nutrients that can be absorbed and used for energy, growth, and repair. The
introduction should briefly mention the organs involved in digestion and set the context for the
importance of this process in health and physical performance.
