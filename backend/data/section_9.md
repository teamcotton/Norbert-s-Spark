Unit 2: 4. Be able to understand joints in the skeleton
o Ligaments: Connect bone to bone, providing joint stability.
o Bursae: Fluid-filled sacs that reduce friction between tissues.
o Menisci (in some joints): Cartilage pads that improve fit between bones and absorb
shock. 3. Types of Synovial Joints and Their Range of Motion:
o Hinge Joints: Movement in one plane (flexion and extension); e.g., elbow, knee.
o Ball-and-Socket Joints: Movement in multiple planes, including rotation; e.g., shoulder,
hip.
o Pivot Joints: Rotation around a single axis; e.g., atlantoaxial joint in the neck.
o Saddle Joints: Movement in two planes, including flexion-extension and abduction-
adduction; e.g., thumb carpometacarpal joint.
o Condyloid (Ellipsoid) Joints: Movement in two planes but no rotation; e.g., wrist joint.
o Gliding (Plane) Joints: Sliding or gliding movements; e.g., intercarpal joints. 4. Joint Movement Potential and Joint Actions:
o Common joint actions include flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, rotation,
circumduction, pronation, supination, dorsiflexion, and plantarflexion.
o The range of motion depends on the joint type and its anatomical features. 5. Factors Limiting Joint Range of Motion:
o Structural factors: Bone shape, joint capsule tightness, ligament length.
o Muscle tightness or weakness: Can restrict or alter movement.
o Injury or inflammation: Swelling and pain limit mobility.
o Age and disease: Conditions like arthritis reduce joint flexibility.
o Scar tissue or adhesions from surgery or trauma.
Essay Snippet 4.1 – 4.5
Joints are the connections between bones that allow the body to move and maintain stability. They are
classified based on their structure and movement capacity into fibrous, cartilaginous, and synovial joints.
Fibrous joints, such as the sutures in the skull, are immovable and joined by fibrous tissue. Cartilaginous
joints allow slight movement and are connected by cartilage, as seen in the intervertebral discs of the
spine. Synovial joints, the most common and movable joints in the body, possess a fluid-filled cavity that
facilitates smooth movement.
The structure of synovial joints is complex and highly specialised to allow movement while maintaining
stability. The ends of the bones are covered with articular cartilage, a smooth tissue that reduces friction.
The entire joint is enclosed within a fibrous joint capsule, lined by the synovial membrane, which secretes
synovial fluid to lubricate and nourish the joint. Ligaments connect bones and help stabilise the joint,
while bursae are small fluid-filled sacs that reduce friction between moving tissues. Some synovial joints
also contain menisci, which are cartilage pads that improve the fit between bones and act as shock
absorbers.
There are six types of synovial joints, each allowing different ranges of motion. Hinge joints, such as the
elbow and knee, permit movement in one plane—flexion and extension. Ball-and-socket joints, like the
shoulder and hip, allow movement in multiple planes and include rotation. Pivot joints enable rotational
movement around a single axis, as seen in the neck. Saddle joints allow movement in two planes,
including flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction, exemplified by the thumb’s carpometacarpal
joint. Condyloid joints permit movement in two planes but no rotation, such as the wrist joint. Lastly,
gliding joints, like the intercarpal joints, allow sliding or gliding motions between bones…
