## The skeletal system and the effects of exercise

The skeletal system provides the framework  
The muscles generate movement of the skeletal framework  
The heart and circulatory system pump oxygen and nutrients to fuel the muscles  
The respiratory system takes in oxygen and removes waste products  
The nervous system processes and responds to all demand and actions  
The digestive system breaks down and stores the nutrients required for energy production

Skelton makes up one firth of body weight - bone and cartilage

There are three main types of cartilage in the body - hyaline, elastic and fibrocartilage

Axial skeleton - bones that form the main frame or axis the spine, ribs and skull -

Appendicular skeleton - bones that attach to the main frame

## Bones

**Long bones **

- [ ] Have a greater length than width
- [ ] Consist of a main shaft and usually two extremities - femur, fibula, tibia

**Short bones**

- [ ] Normally about as long as they are wide - tarsals, carpals
- [ ] Normally as long as they are wide. Usually highly cancellous, which gives them strength and reduced weight - scapula, cranial bones, costal, ilium

**Irregular bones**

Calcaneus / Vertegbra

**Patella**

Develop within particular tendons of a site of considerable friction or tension

**Flat bones**

Tone of cancellous bone sandwiched between two plate-like layers of compact bone -

### The structure of a long bone

**Hyaline cartilage**  
This covers the end of the bone (the epihysis), where the bones meet to form joints

**Compact bone **

This runs through the shaft of the bone; it is solid and strong to help the long bone withstand weight-bearing stress

**Periosteum**  
A tough, fibrous sheath covering the whole bone

**Yellow marrow**  
This functions for the storage of fat. It is found in the medullary cavity

**Medullar cavity**  
This is the hollow tube which runs down the centre of the diaphysis (the marrow cavity

**Epiphyseal plates**  
These are the growth plates and epiphysis that allow the former to increase in length until adulthood

**Epiphysis**  
This Is the extended portion located at each end of the bone, It contains the spongy, cancellous bone tissue

**Diaphysis**  
This is the shaft of the bone. It contains a thick layer of hard, compact bone with a hollow centre

### Functions of the skeletal system

**Shape**  
The skeletal bones give the body its basic shape

**Protection**  
For example, the skulls protects the brain and the ribs protect the heart

**Attachment**  
Ligaments, tendons

**Movement**  
Muscles pull on long bones to create movement, ie the tibia and fibula are pulled backwards to flex the knee

**Production**  
Some bones produce red (to carry oxygen) and white (to fight infection) blood cells from their marrow

**Storage**  
Bones store important minerals, such as calcium and phosphorus, which support growth and development

A joint is the junction where bones meet  
There are three different types of joints:

**Fibrous joints**  
Movement range: fixed/immovable, example: Cranium (skull)

**Cartilaginous joints**  
Movement range: Slightly movable, example: vertebrae

**Synovial joints**  
Movement range: Freely movable, example: ankle, knee, hip, elbow, shoulder, neck and wrist

Synovial joints are the most commonly found type  
Breaks down into

**Tendons**  
These connect muscle to bone to create movement

**Synovial membrane**  
This stores and secretes synovial fluid when required

**Joint cavity**  
This is the space inside the synovial joint

**Synovial fluid**  
This lubricates the joint during movement

**Ligaments**  
These connect bone to bone to stabilise joints and align bones

**Cartilage**

Cartilage is a dense, durable, tough fibrous connective tissue that is able to withstand compression forces (when running and jumping). Cartilage does not have a blood supply, so it has limited ability to repair itself

Consideration for exercise:  
Cartilage is dependent on regular activity for health  
Cartilage can be worn or torn, through overuse, repetitive movement (high-impact)

**Ligaments**

Ligaments are made of tough, white, non-elastic fibrous tissue is strung together in a cord or strap-like formation. They can withstand a lot of tension, but prolonged tension will permanently damage the fibres

Ligaments have four main functions with the body: attaching and connecting bone to bone in a all joints; enhancing joint stability; guiding joint motion and alignment; preventing excessive or unwanted motion in the joint

**Tendons**

Tendons attach muscle to bone across the joint and transmit the force produced by the muscle. They are formed from all the fibres and connective tissue of the muscle. For example, the Achilles tendon attaches the calf muscles to the heel bone and the quadriceps tendon crosses the knee joint and attaches to the tibia

## There are six types of synovial joints:

**Hinge joint**  
Range of motion: allows bending and straightening  
Examples: the knee and elbow joint  
Actions: Flexion and extension

Sgpepb

**Saddle joint**  
Range of motion: allows movement back and forth and side-to-side  
Example: The carpometacarpal joint  
Action: Adduction and abduction, flexion and extension

**Gliding joint**  
Range of motion: allows two bones to slide past each other  
Examples: The shoulder girdle and the mid-carpal and mid-tarsal joints of the wrist and ankle  
Action: Elevation and depression of the shoulder girdle

**Pivote joint**  
Range of motion: Allows rotation around an axis  
Examples: In the neck, the atlas rotates around the axis. In the forearms, the radius and ulna twist around each other  
Action: rotation

**Ellipsoid joint**  
Range of motion: Similar to a ball-and-socket joint - it allows the same type of movement but to a lesser degree  
Example: Joints between the hand and the fingers  
Action: Flexion, extension, adduction and circumduction

**Pivot joint**  
Range of motion: Allows rotation around an axis  
Examples: in the neck, the atlas rotate around the axis. In the forearms, the radius and ulna twisit around each other  
Action: rotation

**Ball-and-socket joint**  
Range of motion: Allows for movement in almost any direction  
Examples: The shoulder and hip joint  
Actions: Flexion, extension, rotation, circumductiuon, adduction and abduction

**Movements and terminology**

**Shoulder movements**  
Movement possible: Abduction, adduction, Flexion, Extension, External

**Shoulder girdle movement**  
Movement possible: Elevation, Depression, Protection and Retraction

**Spinal movement **  
Movement possible: Extension, Flexion, Lateral flexion and Rotation

**Elbow movement**  
Movement possible: Flexion, Extension, Supination and Pronation

**Movement terminology**  
**Hip Movements**  
Movement possible: Abduction, Adduction, Flexion, Extension, External rotation, internal rotation, Internal rotation, and Cicumduction

**Knee movements**  
Movement possible: Flexion and Extension

**Ankle movements:** Movement possible: Eversion, inversion,

**The spine and its structure**

**From top to bottom:**  
**Cervical spine: **  
This regions allows large movements of rotation, lateral extension and flexion extension. The skull sits on the top of the atlas bone to enable flexion/extension (nodding the head) and lateral flexion, while the axis bone sits underneath to create a pivot joint with atlas bone to enable rotation

**Thoracic spine:**  
The region allows the same movements as the cervical verbose but in smaller ranges

**Lumpar spine:**  
This region allows the same movements as the cervical and thoriacic vertebrae but they are very limited. The lumbar vertebrae ar the largest as they absorb the most shock through the spine

**Sacrol and Coccyx:** the bottom two sections are fused together and allow no movement

Neutral spine  
Through the ear lobe, through the axis of the shoulder, through greater trochanter, slightly anterior to the axis of the knew, slightly anterior to the lateral malleolus

**Postural abnormalities**  
**Reasons for deviation from neutral spine:**  
**Sustained poor postures** (eg driving, bad sittings) that result in changes in opposing muscle length and strength  
**Exercise or sport imbalances:** an exerciser that only trains ‘mirror muscles’ - pectorals and biceps  
Age-related conditions  
Medical conditions

**Postural deviations**  
**Hyperkyphosis **  
The muscles at the front of the chest (pectorals) and upper back (upper trapezius) are short and the muscles of the middle back (rhomboids and lower trapezius) are lengthened. This gives hunched back appearance

**Hyperlordosis**  
The abdominal muscles (rectus abdomens) and trunk stabilising muscles (transverses admininis) are weaker and the back extensor muscles (erector spinae) are short and tight. This gives a hollow back appearance

**Scoliosis**  
Scoliosis is a sideways curve in the spine, which can occur in different vertebrae and even curve back the other way to form an ’s’ shape

**The life cycle of the skeletal system**

The basic shape and size of a persons skeleton is determined by genes and environmental factors  
In a fully developed skeleton, bone contains living and non-living tissue  
The living tissues are the blood vessels, nerves, collagen and bone cells, including: **Osteoblasts: **cells that deposit calcium to help form bone  
**Osteoclasts: **mature osteoblasts that have ended their bone-forming role

Ossification: bone formation from the activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts with the addition of minerals and salts  
Osteoblasts take calcium compounds from the blood and deposit them in the bone

**Stages of bone growth**

**Foetal stage**  
In the foetus, most of the skeleton is made up of cartilage: a touch, flexible connective tissue containing no minerals or salts. As the foetus grows, osteoblasts and ossification begins. Many oil the bones have been at least partly formed (ossified) by the time we are born

**Birth to adulthood**

In long bones, the growth and elongation of(lengthening) continue from birth through adolescence.

Bone lengthening is achieved through the activity of two cartilage plates (epiphyseal plates) located between the shaft (diaphysis) and the heads (epiphyses) of the bones. The epiphyseal plates expand, forming new cells and enabling the diaphysis to lengthen at both ends and the heads of the bone to move progressively apart  
As growth continues, the thickness or the epiphyseal plates gradually decreases and the bone lengthening process ends. Different bones stop lengthening at different ages, but ossification is fully complete between the ages of 18 and 30. During this lengthening period, the stresses of physical activity result in the strengthening of the bone tissue  
Bone thickness and strength must be continually maintained. Old bone must be replaced by new bone to maintain strength and mass.

**Adulthood to later life**

Calcium is progressively lost from the bone as the skeleton ages; this happens earlier in women. Loss of calcium and bone mass can to osteoporosis. Osteoporosis increases the risk of fractures and is responsible for loss of height and changes in posture (hunched back) in senior years

**Factors affecting bone formation**

**Nutrition**

- [ ] A nutritious diet is essential for bone health; the mineral, calcium, is especially important. Calcium-rich foods include dairy products (milk and cheese), oily fish and green vegetables
- [ ] Bone health can be compromised by excessive intake of caffeine, alcohol and carbonated drinks, as these inhibit the absorption of calcium

**Sunlight**

- [ ] Exposing the skin to the ultraviolet portion of sunlight is favourable to bone development because the skin can produce vitamin D when exposed to such radiation
- [ ] Vitamin D is necessary for the proper absorption of calcium in the small intestine. If calcium is poorly absorbed, the bone matrix will be deficient in calcium and the bone are likely to be deformed or very weak

**Hormonal secretions**

- [ ] Horomones produced by the endocrine system have a significant role to play in bone development and growth.
- [ ] The growth hormone secreted by the pituitary gland is responsible for general development
- [ ] The short term effects of exercise is that it will help reduce friction in joints by increasing the secretion of synovial fluids.
- [ ] An instructor can also help a client to prevent injuries by teaching exercise that improve balance
- [ ] However, these exercises do not instantly make joints more stable - that effect comes with time. Another short-term effect of exercise is that it increases the flow of blood and therefore nutrients to joints

## Short-terms effects and long-term benefits of exercise on the skeletal system

**Short-term, immediate effects**

- [ ] Increased secretion of synovial fluid in joints, which reduces wear and tear
- [ ] Increase in blood flow and nutrients to bone and joints
- [ ] Muscles pull on bone to increase range of movement (ROM)

**Long-term benefits**

- [ ] Increased bone density and bone strength
- [ ] Increase joint stability due to stronger ligaments and tendons.
- [ ] Improved posture
- [ ] Improved cartilage health
- [ ] Increased range of movement (ROM), leading to improved flexibility
- [ ] Reduced risk of osteoporosis
- [ ] Reduced risk of fractures

LAP

These increase stress on the spine and surrounding soft tissue structures, while decreasing he efficiency with which the body moves  
Normal thoracic and lumbar curves should be approximately 20-45 degrees when in a static neutral position

Circulatory system - the heart and circulatory system pump oxygen and nutrients to fuel muscles

The anatomical position is defined as the body in an upright position with legs parallel, arms by the sides of the body and the palms facing forward

The skeleton system consists of two main types of connective tissue: bones and different types of cartilage. Bone is the calcified connective tissue that forms most of the adult skeleton. There around 206 bones in the body connected via a series of different types of joints

Inside bones, red and white blood cells are produced in the bone marrow. Vital minerals, including calcium, are stored in the bone.

The axial skeleton consists of the bones that form the main frame or axis: the spine, ribs and skulll

The appendicular skeleton consists of the bones that attach to the main frame: the upper and lower limbs, the pelvic and should girdles

Bones are classified according to their formation and shape:

Longs bones -  
Short bones
