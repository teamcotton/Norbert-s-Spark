# Understand how energy is produced in the body and the effects of exercise on energy production

## Adenosine triphospthate

- [ ] All functions of the body require energy, including muscle contraction, digestion, respiration, repair and growth
- [ ] To power there functions, important chemicals reactions must occur continually at cellular level throughout the body
- [ ] All living organisms need the high-energy molecule, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to function
- [ ] ATP: The energy currency of cellular life and only fuel the human body recognise and uses
- [ ] ATP captures chemical energy, obtaining from the breakdown of food molecules, and releases it to fuel other cellular processes

### Structure of ATP

- [ ] ATP is composed of one adenosine molecule bonded with three phosphate molecules. Energy is stored in this phosphate bonds
- [ ] ATP releases is energy when one of its high-energy phosphate bonds is broken and it is converted to adenosine diphosphate (ADP)
- [ ] Once stores of ATP have been used up, it has to be remade. This is achieved through the breakdown of phosphocreatine or certain nutrients eg: carbohydrate, fat and protein

## The different energy systems

- [ ] Phosphocreatine (creatine phosphate or CP) system
- [ ] Lactate system
- [ ] Aerobic system

### The creatine phosphate (CP) system

- [ ] The CP system provides ATP to primary fuel high-intensity, explosive activity, ie shot or 100m sprint
- [ ] It is also used to initiate most movement, regardless of intensity, as it is readily available in muscle tissue
- [ ] CP can generate ATP almost immediately by using its phosphate molecule
- [ ] CP has a high-energy bond that releases enough energy to yield an ATP molecule when broken down by creatine kinase
- [ ] The reaction is very quick but only lasts for a short time because of limited CP stores
- [ ] The CP system is exhausted after a maximum of ten seconds

### Lactate system

- [ ] Used predominantly fuel high-intensity exercise that lasts longer than 10 seconds, ie a 400m race
- [ ] Also involved In lower-intensity exercise when the demand for oxygen and glycogen stored in the liver cannot be met
- [ ] Taps into stores of glycogen (stored form of carbohydrate) in the muscles to fuel ATP by breaking to down into glucose without oxygen
- [ ] Glucose is continually being converted to lactic acid in the body; it only becomes a problem when lactic acid starts to accumulate (because the rate of production exceeds the body’s ability to dispense it)
- [ ] A build-up of lactic acid will eventually cause activity to stop - onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA)
- [ ] OBLA is associated with certain sensations, ie laboured breathing (or breathlessness), ‘heavy’ limbs and pain (‘the bum’)

## Training considerations for the lactate system

**Interval training**

Targeted interval training improves the body’s ability to withstand the build-up of lactic acid and/or the ability to remove it quickly, which delays or prevents accumulation

**Anaerobic training**

Anaerobic training sues up the glycogen stored in the muscle quickly and requires short periods (1-3 minutes) of strenuous activity followed by periods of recovery. Ideally this recovery should be active (ie walking between running intervals) to aid the return of blood to the liver. Insufficient recovery, or static rest, might not allow the lactic acid to be dispersed before the commencement of the next interval

**Aerobic system**

- [ ] Aerobic: ‘with oxygen’
- [ ] Produces ATP from the complete breakdown of carbohydrate, fat and protein in the presence of oxygen
- [ ] Dominant when there is enough oxygen in the cells to see the energy production requirements, ie at rest or doing low-to-moderate-intensity activity
- [ ] Fat (fatty acids) and carbohydrate (glucose) are the two main macronutrients that supply the ATP during aerobic metabolism - both are required in varying proportions
- [ ] By-products: Carbon dioxide, water (H2O) and heat from the breakdown of fat and carbohydrate - easily removed through exhalation and sweating, respectively

**Measures of cardiovascular and respiratory fitness**

- [ ] Oxygen uptake/consumption: use of oxygen by the cells of the body
- [ ] When at rest, oxygen uptake (VO2) is about 3.5ml of oxygen per kilogram of bodyweight per minute (ml/kg/min) - also known as 1 metabolic equivalent
- [ ] Intensity can be gauged according to the amount of oxygen update required
- [ ] The maximal amount of oxygen a person can take in (respiratory), transport (cardiovascular) and utilise (muscular) provides an indication of their fitness
- [ ] The more oxygen taken in and used by the muscles, the higher the intensity the person could work at and the fitter they would be
- [ ] The maximal oxygen update (VO2max) is thought to be the best way to measure someone’s fitness levels - can be directly measured or estimated using various aerobic fitness tests

## Location of ATP production

**Mitichondrion: **  
**Aerobic energy: **aerobic energy production occurs in small cell structures called mitochondria; these are referred to as the ‘powerhouse’ of a cell.

The large and/or more plentiful the mitochondria, the greater the potential for aerobic ATP production of that cell. This indicates that an athlete could run, swim or cycle at a higher intensity for a sustained period of time without fatigue

**Anaerobic energy: **Anaerobic energy production (CP and lactate systems) occurs in the muscle cells but outside the mitochondria

The interaction of energy systems during exercise:

- [ ] A gold swing or shot put would predominantly use the CP system
- [ ] A 400m sprint or a squash or tennis rally would predominantly use the lactate system
- [ ] A long-distance marathon run would predominantly use the aerobic system

Note: learn the system between aerobic and anaerobic
