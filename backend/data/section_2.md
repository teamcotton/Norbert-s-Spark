Unit 2: 1. Be able to understand the structure and function of the circulatory system

1. Location of the Heart:
   o Situated slightly left of the midline of the chest, between the lungs, in the thoracic cavity
   (mediastinum).
   o Protected by the ribcage and surrounded by a sac called the pericardium.
2. Structure and Function of the Heart:
   o Four chambers: right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, and left ventricle.
   o Valves (tricuspid, bicuspid/mitral, pulmonary, aortic) maintain one-way blood flow.
   o Myocardium (heart muscle) contracts rhythmically to pump blood.
3. Blood Flow Through the Heart:
   o Deoxygenated blood enters the right atrium → tricuspid valve → right ventricle →
   pulmonary valve → pulmonary artery → lungs (gas exchange).
   o Oxygenated blood returns via pulmonary veins → left atrium → bicuspid/mitral valve →
   left ventricle → aortic valve → aorta → systemic circulation.
4. Pulmonary vs. Systemic Circulation:
   o Pulmonary: Carries deoxygenated blood to lungs and brings back oxygenated blood.
   o Systemic: Delivers oxygenated blood to the body and returns deoxygenated blood to
   the heart.
5. Structure and Function of Blood Vessels:
   o Arteries: Thick, muscular, carry blood away from the heart under high pressure.
   o Veins: Thinner walls, valves prevent backflow, return blood to the heart.
   o Capillaries: Microscopic vessels where exchange of gases, nutrients, and waste occurs
   between blood and tissues.
   Essay Snippet 1.1 – 1.6
   The heart is a muscular organ located slightly to the left of the chest, between the lungs, within the
   thoracic cavity. It is enclosed by the pericardium and protected by the ribcage. As the central component
   of the circulatory system, the heart’s primary function is to pump blood throughout the body to supply
   oxygen and nutrients and remove waste products.
   The heart consists of four chambers: two atria at the top and two ventricles at the bottom. The right
   atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the body via the superior and inferior vena cava. Blood flows
   through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle, which contracts to send blood through the pulmonary
   valve into the pulmonary artery, leading to the lungs. Here, gas exchange occurs, and oxygen-rich blood
   returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. The blood then passes through the mitral (bicuspid)
   valve into the left ventricle, which pumps it into the aorta via the aortic valve to supply the rest of the
   body through systemic circulation.
   Pulmonary circulation involves the movement of blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs and
   back to the left side. This process allows carbon dioxide to be expelled and oxygen to be absorbed. In
   contrast, systemic circulation moves oxygenated blood from the left side of the heart through the aorta
   to tissues throughout the body and returns deoxygenated blood to the right atrium…
