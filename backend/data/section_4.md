Introduction: Be Able to Understand the Structure and Function of the Respiratory System
Understanding the structure and function of the respiratory system is vital for recognising how the body
takes in oxygen and removes carbon dioxide. The system includes key organs such as the nose, trachea,
lungs, and diaphragm, all working together to enable breathing. Oxygen is transported into the
bloodstream through gas exchange in the lungs, supporting energy production during rest and exercise.
This knowledge is essential for fitness professionals, as it helps explain how breathing efficiency impacts
performance and overall health.

2.7 Describe the composition of gases in both inhaled and exhaled air
The student should start by introducing the lungs as the primary organs of the respiratory system,
essential for gas exchange, providing oxygen to the blood and removing carbon dioxide. The essay will
cover lung location, structure, function, main respiratory muscles, air passage through the respiratory
tract, gaseous exchange, and the composition of inhaled and exhaled air.

Unit 2: 2. Be able to understand the structure and function of the respiratory system

1. Location of the Lungs:
   o The lungs are located in the thoracic cavity, protected by the ribcage and separated by
   the mediastinum, which contains the heart and major vessels.
2. Structure and Function of the Lungs:
   o Each lung is divided into lobes (right lung: 3 lobes; left lung: 2 lobes).
   o Surrounded by the pleura, a double-layered membrane that reduces friction during
   breathing.
   o Function: To facilitate the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air and
   the bloodstream.
3. Main Muscles Involved in Breathing:
   o Diaphragm: Primary muscle of inspiration; contracts and flattens to enlarge the thoracic
   cavity.
   o Intercostal muscles: Located between ribs; external intercostals assist inhalation by
   lifting ribs, internal intercostals aid forced exhalation.
4. Passage of Air Through the Respiratory Tract:
   o Air enters via the nose/mouth → pharynx → larynx → trachea → bronchi (right and
   left) → bronchioles → alveoli (site of gas exchange).
5. Process of Gaseous Exchange:
   o Occurs in the alveoli, tiny air sacs with thin walls surrounded by capillaries.
   o Oxygen diffuses from alveolar air into blood; carbon dioxide diffuses from blood into
   alveolar air to be exhaled.
6. Composition of Inhaled and Exhaled Air:
   o Inhaled air: ~21% oxygen, 0.04% carbon dioxide, 78% nitrogen, and other gases.
   o Exhaled air: ~16% oxygen, 4-5% carbon dioxide, 78% nitrogen, showing oxygen has been
   absorbed and carbon dioxide released.
   Essay Snippet 2.1 – 2.7
   The lungs are essential organs located within the thoracic cavity, protected by the ribcage and separated
   centrally by the mediastinum, which houses the heart and major blood vessels. Their primary role is to
   enable gas exchange — supplying oxygen to the bloodstream and removing carbon dioxide, a metabolic
   waste product.
   Structurally, the right lung consists of three lobes while the left lung has two lobes to accommodate the
   heart’s position. Each lung is enveloped by a double-layered pleural membrane that reduces friction as
   the lungs expand and contract during breathing. Within the lungs, branching airways divide into smaller
   bronchioles, ending in clusters of microscopic air sacs called alveoli, which provide a vast surface area for
   efficient gaseous exchange.
   Breathing is driven by the coordinated action of several muscles. The diaphragm is the primary muscle
   responsible for inspiration. When it contracts, it flattens downward, increasing the volume of the
   thoracic cavity and creating a negative pressure that draws air in. The external intercostal muscles,
   located between the ribs, assist by lifting the ribcage upwards and outwards. During forceful exhalation,
   the internal intercostal muscles contract to pull the ribs down and in, decreasing thoracic volume and
   expelling air…
