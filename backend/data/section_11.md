Introduction: Be Able to Understand the Muscular System
Understanding the muscular system is essential to knowing how the body produces movement and
maintains posture. The muscular system consists of different types of muscles—skeletal, smooth, and
cardiac—that work together to enable voluntary and involuntary actions. Skeletal muscles attach to
bones and are responsible for movement, while smooth and cardiac muscles control functions like
digestion and heartbeats. Knowledge of the muscular system helps fitness professionals design effective
exercise programmes that improve strength, flexibility, and overall physical function.
5.1 Identify the three types of muscle tissue
5.2 Define the characteristics and functions of the three types of muscle tissue
5.3 Describe the role of fascia in the body
The student should begin by introducing the three types of muscle tissue found in the human body—
skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle. They should explain that each type has unique characteristics and
functions essential for different bodily activities. The essay will also describe fascia, the connective tissue
that supports and separates muscles.

1. Skeletal Muscle:
   o Voluntary muscle attached to bones.
   o Striated appearance under a microscope.
   o Responsible for body movement, posture, and heat production.
