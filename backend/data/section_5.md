Introduction: Be Able to Understand the Structure and Function of the Skeleton
Understanding the structure and function of the skeleton is fundamental to learning how the body
maintains its shape, protects vital organs, and enables movement. The human skeleton is made up of
bones, joints, and connective tissues that provide support and act as attachment points for muscles. It
also plays a key role in producing blood cells and storing minerals. Knowledge of the skeletal system
helps fitness professionals design safe and effective exercise programmes that support bone health and
prevent injury.
3.1 Describe the basic functions of the skeleton
3.2 Identify the structures of the axial skeleton
3.3 Identify the structures of the appendicular skeleton
The student should begin by explaining that the human skeleton provides the essential framework for
the body, offering support, protection, and enabling movement. The essay will describe the basic
functions of the skeleton and identify the two main parts: the axial and appendicular skeletons.

1. Basic Functions of the Skeleton:
   o Support: Provides structural support for the body and maintains its shape.
   o Protection: Protects vital organs (e.g., skull protects the brain, ribcage protects the
   heart and lungs).
   o Movement: Acts as a system of levers with muscles attached to bones, allowing
   movement.
   o Mineral Storage: Stores essential minerals such as calcium and phosphorus.
   o Blood Cell Production: Bone marrow produces red and white blood cells.

2. Axial Skeleton:
   o Comprises 80 bones forming the central axis of the body.
   o Includes the skull, vertebral column (spine), rib cage, and sternum.
   o Primarily responsible for protection of the brain, spinal cord, and thoracic organs.
3. Appendicular Skeleton:
   o Comprises 126 bones related to movement.
   o Includes pectoral girdle (shoulder blades and collar bones), upper limbs (arms, wrists,
   hands), pelvic girdle (hip bones), and lower limbs (legs, ankles, feet).
   o Facilitates locomotion and manipulation of objects.
   Essay Snippet 3.1 – 3.3
   The human skeleton serves as the body’s structural framework, providing support, protection, and
   enabling movement. Its basic functions are vital for everyday activities and overall health. The skeleton
   supports the body’s shape and posture, allowing us to stand upright. It protects delicate internal organs;
   for example, the skull encases the brain, and the rib cage shields the heart and lungs. Additionally, bones
   act as levers that muscles pull on to produce movement. Beyond these mechanical roles, the skeleton
   stores important minerals such as calcium and phosphorus, which are essential for bone strength and
   metabolic processes. Bone marrow within certain bones is also responsible for producing red and white
   blood cells, critical for oxygen transport and immune defense.
   The skeleton is divided into two main parts: the axial and appendicular skeletons. The axial skeleton
   consists of 80 bones forming the central axis of the body. This includes the skull, which protects the brain;
   the vertebral column or spine, which supports the head and trunk while protecting the spinal cord; and
   the rib cage and sternum, which protect the heart and lungs.
   The appendicular skeleton comprises 126 bones that are mainly involved in movement. It includes the
   pectoral girdle—made up of the shoulder blades and collarbones—which connects the upper limbs to the
   trunk. The upper limbs consist of the arms, wrists, and hands, while the pelvic girdle connects the lower
   limbs to the spine. The lower limbs include the legs, ankles, and feet, which support body weight and
   enable locomotion…
   3.4 Explain the classification of bones
   3.5 Identify examples of bones which fit into each bone classification
   3.6 Explain the structure of long bone
   3.7 Explain the stages of bone growth
   The student should start by explaining that bones come in different shapes and sizes, each adapted for
   specific functions in the body. Understanding the classification of bones helps in studying their roles and
   structure. The essay will describe the major bone classifications with examples, explain the structure of
   a long bone, and outline the stages of bone growth.
