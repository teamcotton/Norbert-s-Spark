**The nervous system**

- [ ] How the nervous system functions
- [ ] The structure of the nervous system

**The combined work of the muscular and nervous system**

**The muscular system**

- [ ] All body movement requires communication between brain and muscles
- [ ] There are over 600 muscles in the body, making up around 40% of a persons total weight
- [ ] The bones and joints make up a a framework of levers (bones) and pivots (joints
- [ ] Movement is generated through the contradiction and relations of the muscles
- [ ] The muscular system generates body movements (walking and jumping) and powers internal processes (heart muscle and contraction and focussing of the eye)

## There are three types of muscle tissue

**Cardiac muscle tissue**  
**Control:** Involuntary, not under conscious control  
**Appearance: **Skriated (striped or streaked  
**Location:** The heart, to ensure continuous rhythmic beating in order to push oxygen around the body

**Smooth**  
**Control:** Involuntary, not under conscious control  
**Appearance:** Smooth, spindle-shaped  
**Location: **The digestive system, to break down ingested food and drink. The walls of blood vessels, to control the volume of bloody flow

**Skeletal**  
**Control:** Voluntary, under conscious control  
**Appearence:** Skriated  
**Location:** Biceps, triceps, quadriceps. To create body movement. Some muscles contract to stabilised the body and prevent unwanted movement

## The characteristics of muscle tissue

**Muscle tissue has four key characteristics**  
**Contractility:** The ability to shorten  
**Extensibility**: The ability to stretch and lengthen  
**Elasticity:** The ability to return to its original size and shape  
**Excitability:** The ability to respond to stimuli from the nervous system

Examples:  
The heart contracts to pump blood and relaxes to fill with blood  
The skeletal muscles work in pairs and contract and relax to create movement of the skeleton  
Smooth muscle is controlled by the automatic nervous system  
Contraction of the heart is controlled by the sinoatrial nod

Muscle is elastic; it can stretch and then recoil to its original shape  
Skeletal muscle is like an elastic band; if the muscle is pulled too far it can tear.

**Structure of skeletal muscle:**  
Bone: Tendon: layers of proactive tissue. Strong, elastic, strap-like Epimysium: single muscle fibre  
Perimysium: Sheath that surrounds the bone  
Fasciculi:  
Myoribril:  
Endomysium:  
Muscle fibre:

The sliding filament theory

**1. The main players**  
Inside each muscle fiber are repeating units called **sarcomeres**. These are the basic contractile units.  
Each sarcomere contains two key protein filaments:  
**Thick filaments**

- Made mostly of **myosin**
- Myosin heads stick out like little oars  
  **Thin filaments**
- Made mainly of **actin**
- Supported by regulatory proteins: **troponin** and **tropomyosin**

**2. What triggers contraction?**  
A nerve impulse causes the muscle cell to release **calcium ions (Ca²⁺)** from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.  
Calcium binds to **troponin**, which causes **tropomyosin** to shift out of the way, exposing active sites on actin.  
Now myosin can interact with actin.

**3. Cross-bridge formation**  
Myosin heads attach to exposed binding sites on actin. This connection is called a **cross-bridge**.

**4. The power stroke**  
When the cross-bridge forms:

1. The myosin head pivots.
2. It pulls the actin filament toward the center of the sarcomere (the M-line).
3. This shortens the sarcomere.  
   This step uses the energy stored from **ATP**.

**5. Release and reset**  
For the myosin head to let go of actin:

1. A new **ATP molecule binds** to the myosin head.
2. Myosin **detaches** from actin.
3. ATP is split into ADP + Pi, which **re-cocks** the head into its ready position.  
   If calcium is still present, the cycle repeats.

**6. Summed effect = muscle contraction**  
Millions of sarcomeres shortening at the same time cause:

- Fibers to shorten
- The entire muscle to contract

**7. Relaxation**  
When the nerve signal stops:

1. Calcium is pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
2. Tropomyosin covers the actin binding sites again.
3. Myosin can no longer bind.
4. The muscle returns to its resting length.

**In a sentence**  
Muscles contract because **myosin pulls actin filaments past each other**, shortening each sarcomere, and this sliding action (powered by ATP and controlled by calcium) produces force.

**2. Easy analogy**  
Imagine **two ropes** (actin) on either side of a person (myosin).

- The person grabs the ropes with both hands (cross-bridge formation).
- They pull hand-over-hand to draw the ropes inward (power stroke).
- After each pull, they let go and grab further along the rope (detachment + recock using ATP).
- If they keep doing this, the ropes move inward and the whole system shortens (muscle contraction).  
  Calcium is the signal that says **“start pulling”**, and ATP is the **fuel** that lets the person grip, pull, release, and repeat.

## Skeletal muscle tissue

**Fibre type:**  
**Slow twitch or type 1:**  
**Structural features: **  
Smaller diameter  
Large myoglobin content  
Many mitochondria  
Many capillaries to deliver bloody and oxygen  
Red in colour

**Functional features: **  
Increased oxygen delivery  
Produce less force  
Long-term contractions  
Resistant to fatigue  
Aerobic

**Activities:**  
Maintaining posture, ie stabilisation  
Endurance-based activities  
Lower-intensity, aerobic activities

**Fast twitch or type II:**  
Large diameter  
Lower myoglobins levels  
Fewer mitochondria  
Fewer Capillaries  
White (pale) in colour

**Functional features:**  
Decreased oxygen delivery  
Generate more force  
Short-term contractions  
Less resistant to fatigue  
Anaerobic

**Activities:**  
Rapid, intense movements  
Strength training  
Sprinting  
Anaerobic training

Most people have a mixture of different fibres in their skeletal muscle  
A persons distribution of fibre types is determined by genetics and heredity; this in turn influences athletic ability:  
Marathon runners have a higher percentage of slow twitch fibres in their muscles  
Sprinters have a higher prercentage of fast twitch fibres in their muscles (about 60%)

The proportion of slow and fast twitch fibres is also determined by the role of the muscle, for example::  
Neck and back muscles play a key role in maintaining correct posture, so they have lots of slow twitch fibres  
Shoulder and arm muscles have more fast twitch fibres, in order to generate considerable force  
Leg muscles often have both fibre types In large quantities, to continually support the body and to generated movement

**The effects of exercise on muscle fibres**

Muscle fibre proportions are affected by exercise and the type of training undertaken:

- [ ] Intense exercise that brings about anaerobic metabolism will boost muscular strength and mass, and increase the size of fast twitch fibres
- [ ] Moderate-intensity, aerobic endurance exercise that increase the volume of bloody and oxygen to the muscle will develop the aerobic capacity of slow twitch fibres.
- [ ] Fast and slow twitch muscle fibres cannot be converted into teach other

Intermediate fibres (a type of fast twitch fibre) can adapt to suit the type of training performed, for example:  
In response to cardiovascular training, intermediate fibres will adapt adapt and respond like slow twitch fibres  
In response to resistance training, they will adapt and respond like other fast twitch fibres

Types of muscle contractions

## Muscles move under tension by either shortening or lengthening, These terms are known as:

**Concentric contraction: **

The muscle shortens under tension, ie the insertion moves towards the origin, for example the curling / upward phase of the bicep curl  
Eccentric contraction: The muscle lengthens under tension, ie the insertion moves away from the origin, the straightening/downward phase of the bicep curls

**Isometric:**

The muscle remains the same length under tension, holding a squat at the bottom of the movement

**Isokinetic:**

The muscle contracts at the same speed throughout the movement

## Origins and insertions

### Each muscle has a start and end point known as the origin and insertion:

**Origin**:

- [ ] The end of the muscle attached to a fixed bone or bones
- [ ] Described as the proximal attachment, ie the nearest to the centre midline of the body (usually the anchor)

**Insertion:**

- [ ] The end of the muscle attached to the bone that usually move during contradiction
- [ ] Described as the distal attachment, ie the one furthest away from the centre midline

Roles of different muscles during movement

**Agonist**  
This is the muscle that contracts and causes a desired action, ie the quadriceps contract during a leg extension

**Antagonist**  
This is the opposing muscle to the agonist that relaxes, ie the hamstrings during a leg extension

**Synergist**  
This is the muscle that contracts to assist or modify the movement of the prime mover, ie during the hip extension the hamstrings act as the synergists for the gluteus Maximus

## The nervous system

The nervous system is responsible for all internal communication and coordination  
It’s primary role is to main a constant balance of the internal environment: homeostasis  
It achieves homeostasis by using the brain and a network of the electrical nerves and chemical messages in the body  
To sum up the role of the nevous system, it is simply to:

1. Gather information (sensation)
2. Analyse the gathered information (integration)
3. Respond appropriately to the information (response)

### How the nervous system functions:

**Sensation:**  
The nervous system gathers information about the internal and external environment. A vast array of sensors throughout the body (including the eyes, and internal proprioceptors) gather information about the internal environment (ie, carbon dioxide levels in the blood) and the external environment (ie, air temperature and space available)  
**Integration:**  
The nervous system intercepts and analyses the information gathered from the sensors and decides on the most appropriate action. Many of these ‘decisions’ are automatic (involuntary) without conscious control, ie digestion. Others are consciously controlled, ie voluntary muscle action  
**Response:**  
The nervous system responds to the information analysed by initiating an appropriate reaction. Responses may include muscle contraction to perform a movement or lift a weight. The nervous system works closely with the endocrine system, which is responsible for releasing hormones (chemicals) to maintain homeostasis

### Structure of the nervous system

The nervous system consist of two primary divisions

- [ ] The central nervous system (CNS)
- [ ] The peripheral nervous system (PNS)

The CNS is

- [ ] The control base for the whole nervous system
- [ ] Compromised of the brain and the spinal cord
- [ ] The point of origin for all nerve impulses that stimulate muscles to contract and generate movement

The PNS subdivides into the

- [ ] Somatic system which controls voluntary (conscious) movement of the skeletal muscles, ie standing, walking, lifting a weight
- [ ] Autonomic system which controls involuntary functions, ie digestion and heart rate

## The structure of the brain

**Cerebrum**  
The largest and most superior aspect. This takes up most of the space in the skull  
**Diencephalon**  
Consists of the thalamus and hypothalamus  
**Brain stem**  
Medulla ablogata, midbrain and pons - the stalk-like component of the inferior aspect of the brain. The lower portion of the continuation of the spinal card  
**Cerebellum**  
The smaller part. It acts a a memory bank for learnt skills and is mainly responsible for controlling the group action of muscles. It communicates and works harmoniously with the cerebrum

**The spinal chord**

- [ ] The spinal chord consists of cervical, thoracic, lumbar and sacral segments
- [ ] Provides a communication link between the brain and the PNS
- [ ] Integrates incoming information and produces responses via reflex mechanisms

**Neurons**

- [ ] Neurons (nerve cells) are responsible for transmitting electrical messages
- [ ] Spinal nerves are divided into motor and sensory neurons
- [ ] Sensory neurons: Carry messages to the NCNS from the sensory organs. Arrive on the posterior side the spinal cord from a variety of sensory receptors spread throughout the body
- [ ] Motor neurons: Transmit impulses fom the CNS to muslces and glands with the specific instructions, ie muscle and contraction or hormone secretion. Exit on the anterior side of the spinal cord

**Structure of the neuron:**

**Nucleus: **The nucleus stores the cell’s genetic information, ie DNA. In simple terms, it tells the cell ‘what to do’  
**Cell body:** The cell body directs the activities of the neuron  
**Axon: **The axon transmits messages away from cell body  
**Dendrite: **Dendrites pick up impulses and transmit these to the cell body  
**Myelin**: The myelin sheath insulates the axon to speed up the transport of messages  
**Nerve ending:**

Motor unit recruitment and the ‘all or none’ low

- [ ] Motor unit: A single motor neuron and all the muscle fibres it innervates
- [ ] A single motor neuron can innverate thousands of muscle fibres, depending on location and function
- [ ] When an impulse is sent down a neuron, all the muscle fibres within that motor unit are innervated
- [ ] The ‘all or nothing’ law: the motor unit activities all of its fibres or none at all
- [ ] The ‘all or none’ law applies to individual motor units, not the entire muscle
- [ ] Only the muscle fibres stimulated but eh motor units recruited contract

### The number and size of motor units

**Muscles with more motor units:**  
The hands, for example, have a lot of small motor units and these supply few fibres to enable finer, more intricate movement, ie playing a musical instrument

**Muscles with fewer motor neurons:**  
The legs and muscles involved in maintaining posture have fewer motor neurons, but the are larger and supply more muscle fibres. Maintaining posture and movement of the legs to walk, kick, run and jump is less intricate than the movement of the hands

**Type of muscle fibre:** A motor unit is typically made up one type of muscle fibre (slow or fast twitch) spread throughout the muscle:

- [ ] For tasks requiring less effort, smaller neurons controlling slow twitch fibres are recruited
- [ ] For tasks requiring more effort, large neurons controlling fast twitch fibres are recruited

### Neuromuscular sensory organs

**Joint receptors: **Are found in the ligaments and joint capsule. They inform the brain about the position of the joint

**Muscle spindles:** Are found in the muscle belly and inform the brain about the length of a surrounding muscle fibre - this helps overstretching and resultant damage

**Golgi tendon organs (GTOs):** are found in the tendons and tell the brain how much tension a muscle is under. If the muscle cannot withstand the amount of tension, the GTOs will cause the muscle to relax to avoid injury

### The lifecycle of the neuromuscular system: Early years

- [ ] Neural pathways (motor connections) increase rapidly in number to develop specific movement patterns and motor skills
- [ ] Postural and stabilising muscles also grow very quickly; a baby can control their head, sit up on their own and eventually walk within the first 12-18 months of life
- [ ] Over this period, the rate of neuromuscular development is influenced by genetics and environment (including opportunities to support neuromuscular development or restrictions that could hinder it)
- [ ] Muscle, as a percentage of body mass, increases:
- [ ] From about 42-54% in boys between the ages of 5 and 11
- [ ] From about 40% to 45% in girls between the ages of 5 and 13

### The lifecycle of the neuromuscular system: Pubescent period

Up until puberty, neuromuscular development is similar to boys and girls. This changes dramatically during adolescence. The growth of neuro pathways slows down significantly in both sexes. However the growth of muscle tissue, or hypertrophy, increases at a much higher rate in boys than in girls. This is due to a surge in sex hormones, testosterone in boys and oestrogen in girls. Testosterone stimulates muscle growth, whereas oestrogen stimulates fat tissue in perperation for bearing children.

### The lifecycle of the neuromuscular system: adulthood and later years

- [ ] In the neuromuscular system, neural pathways and muscular growth that aren’t related to exercise come to a halt around the age of 25
- [ ] If we continue to challenge the neuromuscular system, further is possible beyond our mid-20s
- [ ] Ageing causes a decrease in neurons, in cells from the motor system and in the complement of motor neurons and muscle grawth
- [ ] Loss of neurons starts at age 30
- [ ] The cerebral cortex can most up to 45% of its cells and the brain can weigh 7% less than in the prime of our lives
- [ ] This hinders the relaying of nerve impulse to and from the brain, which slows down the processing of information, as well as voluntary motor movements
- [ ] **Sacropenia:** loss of muscle mass in later life. This happens at a rate of roughly 1-2% each year after the sixth decade

Short-terms effects and long-term benefits of exercise on the neuromuscular system

**Short-term, immediate effects**

- [ ] Increased muscle temperature
- [ ] Increased muscle pliability (ability to stretch further)
- [ ] Increased power output from muscles
- [ ] Increased nerve-to-muscle link
- [ ] Increased recruitment of muscle fibres

**Long-term benefits**

- [ ] Increased muscular endurance/hypertrophy/strength (depending on training intensity)
- [ ] Increased stores of glycogen and creatine phosphate in muscle
- [ ] Increase in contractile protiens, actin and myosin
- [ ] Increased in basal metabolic rate (ability to burn calories at rest)
- [ ] Improved posture
- [ ] Increase in the size and number of capillaries surrounding muscle fibres
- [ ] Increased neuromuscular connections, leading to improvements in skill and motor-related fitness (coordination, reaction time, agility, power, balance and speed)
- [ ] Increased recruitment of motor units, leading to a stronger force generation
