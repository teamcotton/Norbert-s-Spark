In this section:

- [ ] The different types of digestion
- [ ] The process of digestion
- [ ] The breakdown and absorption of food
- [ ] The role of dietary fibre in maintaining effective gut function
- [ ] The roles of the liver and pancreas in assisting digestion
- [ ] Timescales if digestion

## Stages of digestion

- [ ] **Ingestion:** food entering the body through the mouth and being chewed
- [ ] **Digestion:** breaking down of food through mechanical (smooth muscle action) and chemical (release of enzymes) processes
- [ ] **Absorption:** the passing of food into he bloodstream to be used by the body’s tissues
- [ ] **Elimination:** The removal of waste\

## Journey through the alimentary canal (also known as the digestive track or gut

- [ ] **Small intestine: **The small intestine is a small, tightly folder tube that receives food from the stomach. It is a major site of digestion within the alimentary canal. Its role is to absorb import nutrients into the bloodstream to be passed to the body’s tissues. The small intestine is divided into three sections: the duodenum, jejunum and ileum
- [ ] **Large intestine:** The large intestine absorbs water and vitamins from food residue, and forms and stores faeces ready for excretion. It is made up of the colon (large tube that surrounds the abdominal cavity) and the rectum (passageway for faeces, which leads to the anus ( a valve-like exit form the end of the alimentary canal )
- [ ] **Stomach: **The stomach is a muscular bag located on the left side of the upper abdomen. It breaks down food further by releasing enzymes, and also kills bacteria
- [ ] **Oesophagus (gullet):** This is a thick-walled, muscular tube that carries broken down food from the mouth to the stomach
- [ ] **Mouth:** This is the entry point of food and where it begins to be broken down through the process of mastication (chewing) into a ball, or bolus

## Breakdown and absorption of food:

**Carbohydrate**

**Broken down into**  
Amylase, Sucrase, maltase, lactase

**To make**  
Glgogen, then glucose

**To be used for **  
Energy

**Fats**

**Broken down into**  
lipase

**To make**  
Fatty acids and glycerol

**To be used for **  
energy insulation

**Protein**

**Broken down into**  
pepsin, pedtidase

**To make**  
Peptide chains, then amino acids

**To be used for **  
growth, tissue repair

## The role of dietary fibre in maintaining effective gut function

- [ ] Dietary fibre is a type of complex carbohydrates that cannot be digested by the human body
- [ ] Found in foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and cereals
- [ ] Vital for efficient functioning of the digestive system
- [ ] An average adult should eat 30g of fibre per day
- [ ] Fibre helps the gut by:

1. Ensuring the smooth and speedy passing of waste
2. Helping to increase the amount of ‘good bacteria’ in the gut
3. Helping you feel fuller for longer so you are less likely to snack on high-sugar foods - this can prevent obesity and associated conditions, ie type 2 diabetes

- [ ] For fibre to be effective in supporting gut function, you must maintain adequate hydration levels
- [ ] Fluid supports the passing of food through the alimentary canal and helps to facilitate the passing of waste

## Roles of the liver and pancreas in assisting digestion

**Liver: **

- [ ] The liver is the body’s largest internal organ and has many functions that relate specifically to digestion and absorption of food, including:
- [ ] Bile secretion, which is vital for the breakdown of fats in the small intense
- [ ] Removal of nutrients from the blood and conversion for storage. For example, it removes glucose (not used for energy) to be converted back into glycogen
- [ ] Detoxifying harmful substances in the blood, ie alcohol, by converting them into urea to be excreted as urine
- [ ] Storage of vitamins and minerals that have a number of health benefits
- [ ] Removal of bacteria from the bloodstream

**Pancreas:**

- [ ] The pancreas is responsible for secreting digestive juices into the small intestine, which contain the aforementioned enzymes, in order to break down nutrients

**Timescales of digestion**

- [ ] Mouth and oesophagus:  
       Mastification - 30-60 seconds  
       Swallowing - 1-3 seconds
- [ ] Stomach: - 2-6 hours
- [ ] Small intestine: 1-5 hours
- [ ] Large intestine: 9-72 hours
