Introduction: Be Able to Understand Joints in the Skeleton
Understanding joints in the skeleton is important for grasping how movement occurs in the human
body. Joints are the connections between bones that allow flexibility and motion, varying in type and
range of movement depending on their structure. They provide stability while enabling actions such as
bending, twisting, and rotating. Knowledge of joint types and their functions helps fitness professionals
design exercises that improve mobility, prevent injury, and support overall physical health.

The student should open with a clear explanation of what joints are — the connections between bones
that enable movement and provide stability. The essay will cover the classification of joints, focus on the
detailed structure of synovial joints, explore types of synovial joints with their ranges of motion,
describe joint movement potential and common joint actions, and conclude by discussing factors that
can limit joint range of motion.

1. Classification of Joints:
   o Fibrous Joints: Immovable joints connected by fibrous tissue (e.g., sutures of the skull).
   o Cartilaginous Joints: Slightly movable joints connected by cartilage (e.g., intervertebral
   discs, pubic symphysis).
   o Synovial Joints: Freely movable joints characterised by a joint cavity filled with synovial
   fluid.
2. Structure of Synovial Joints:
   o Articular Cartilage: Smooth tissue covering the ends of bones to reduce friction.
   o Joint Capsule: Fibrous tissue enclosing the joint, providing stability.
   o Synovial Membrane: Lines the joint capsule and produces synovial fluid for lubrication.
   o Synovial Fluid: Lubricates and nourishes the joint.
